# Example Special Page

This example also serves as a template for new special pages.

## Creating a new special page

Special Pages must be named in kebab-case. For the example below, we'll assume your new page is called `my-feature`. 

1. Duplicate the folder `special-pages/pages/example` under your new page name

```sh
cp -R special-pages/pages/example special-pages/pages/my-feature
```

2. Find and replace occurrences of `example` with your new page name


### Integration

Serve the entire folder found under `build/<PLATFORM>/pages/example`

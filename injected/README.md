# Content Scope Scripts

Content Scope Scripts handles injecting DOM modifications in a browser context; it's a cross-platform solution that requires some minimal platform hooks.

## Quick Start

Content Scope Scripts provides a unified API for browser privacy features across multiple platforms (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Android, iOS). Features are loaded dynamically based on remote configuration and can be enabled/disabled per site.

## Documentation

ðŸ“š **Detailed documentation is available in the [docs](./docs/) directory:**

- **[API Reference](./docs/api-reference.md)** - Complete reference for the Content Scope Features API
- **[Features Guide](./docs/features-guide.md)** - How to develop features and understand the feature lifecycle  
- **[Platform Integration](./docs/platform-integration.md)** - Platform-specific implementation details
- **[Development Utilities](./docs/development-utilities.md)** - Scope injection utilities and development tools
- **[Testing Guide](./docs/testing-guide.md)** - Local testing and development workflow

## Key Concepts

### Project Structure

Content Scope Scripts contains two main sub-projects:

- **[Special Pages](../special-pages/)** - HTML/CSS/JS applications loaded into browsers (DuckPlayer, Release Notes, New Tab page, etc.)
- **Injected Features** - Features injected into websites (privacy protections, compatibility fixes)

> **For Special Pages development**, see the [Special Pages README](../special-pages/README.md) for detailed getting started instructions.

### Features
Features are JavaScript modules that implement privacy protections. Each feature:
- Extends the `ConfigFeature` class for remote configuration support
- Implements the feature lifecycle (`load`, `init`, `update`)
- Can be enabled/disabled per site via remote configuration

### Platform Support
- **Firefox**: Standard extension content scripts
- **Apple/Android**: UserScripts with string replacements
- **Other browsers**: Base64-encoded script injection

### API
The global `contentScopeFeatures` object provides:
- `load()` - Initialize features that may cause loading delays
- `init(args)` - Main feature initialization with platform/site configuration
- `urlChanged()` - Handle Single Page App navigation
- `update()` - Receive browser updates

[Here’s how it works](https://www.techradar.com/news/about-us#section-affiliate-advertising-disclosure). \n           (Image: © Rafapress / Shutterstock)       Vodafone UK experienced a major outage yesterday that affected thousands of customers across its broadband and mobile networks.\nThe issues started at around 2.38pm BST on October 13, when the website [Downdetector](https://downdetector.co.uk/status/vodafone/) showed an enormous spike in reports. At its peak, almost 135,000 Vodafone customers simultaneously reported problems, making it one of the biggest network outages of 2025. Today there are still over 1,000 customers reporting issues with the broadband or mobile internet.\n  The problems were so widespread that even the official Vodafone website and customer service phone numbers went down. The network later commented on the wide-reaching problems, stating that it was \"aware of a major issue\"** **and was working to resolve it \"as soon as possible\".\nVodafone seems to be largely back to full health and a spokesperson told us that \"the network is now recovering\". Still, over a thousand customers are reporting residual issues – here's how one of the biggest outages of the year played out and all of the latest news...\n \n## Vodafone outage – the latest news\n \n\n- **Vodafone experienced a nationwide outage of its broadband and mobile networks yesterday**\n\n- **The problems started at around 2.38pm BST on October 13, according to Downdetector**\n\n- **Vodafone said it was \"aware of a major issue\", but that \"the network is now recovering\"**\n\n            Get notified of updates    October 13, 2025 at 10:49 AM \n## That's quite an outage\n    \n(Image credit: Downdetector)The Vodafone problems, which are hitting both its mobile network and broadband, started about an hour ago at 2.38pm BST.\nThat Downdetector spike (above) is one of the biggest I've ever seen in terms of concurrent reports – it stands at 126,905 reports and is still on the up.\nThere's been no official statement about the outage yet, but I'll be getting in touch with the network to see what might have happened – and more importantly, when it might be fixed.\n   October 13, 2025 at 11:01 AM \n## Who's been hit?\n     \n(Image credit: Downdetector) Our Computing editor Christian Guyton first noticed the issues when his Wi-Fi and mobile network abruptly stopped working this afternoon – and that's been an experience shared by many.\nAccording to Downdetector, most people (65% of reports) are reporting issues with their landline internet, but a significant number (27%) are also saying their mobile internet is also down.\nIn other words, this is a wide-reaching outage that also appears to be nationwide – the coverage map is spread across the country from London to Glasgow. I've asked Vodafone for comment and will report as soon as I hear back.\n    October 13, 2025 at 11:10 AM \n## No word from Vodafone yet\n ⚠️ Confirmed: Live network data show that operator Vodafone UK is experiencing a national outage with broadband and mobile data impacted, corroborating widespread user complaints 📉 #VodafoneDown pic.twitter.com/fsfpVccZaQ[October 13, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1977739924381061352)\nSee more Vodafone is currently trending on X (formerly Twitter) and that's rarely a good sign for a mobile network. Sadly, we won't be getting any official answers on X, as Vodafone customer care isn't on the platform due to a \"technical change\".\nI've asked Vodafone directly for a response or statement and will post it hear as soon as I get one.\nHowever, it's clear there's a serious problem – for example, the cybersecurity watchdog NetBlocks has reported above that there's a \"national outage\" with \"broadband and mobile data\" impacted.\n   October 13, 2025 at 11:13 AM \n## An official statement from Vodafone\n     \n(Image credit: Shutterstock.com / viewimage) I've just heard from Vodafone about today's issues. A spokesperson told me: \"We are aware of a major issue on our network currently affecting broadband, 4G and 5G services. We appreciate our customers' patience while we work to resolve this as soon as possible.”\nSo there we have it – no estimate of a timescale for the fix yet, but Vodafone has admitted that it's facing a \"major issue\". That's unusually strong language during an outage, which networks tend to play down – but it's a certainly an accurate description given the numbers affected.\n    October 13, 2025 at 11:25 AM \n## Even Vodafone's customer service is down\n     \n(Image credit: Shutterstock / Poetra.RH) I haven't seen a network outage as wide-ranging as this for some time. Not only are Vodafone's broadband and mobile networks down, the issues have also taken out its website and even its customer service phone numbers.\nA TechRadar reader alerted me to the latter and I can confirm the 0333 304 0191 number isn't working for me – the problems also seem to be affecting the 191 number that customers can call from their Vodafone mobile phone.\nOn the plus side, the number of reports on Downdetector appears to be dropping, so it seems some are now at least getting reconnected.\n   October 13, 2025 at 11:41 AM \n## The knock-on effect\n     \n(Image credit: Downdetector) A high number of customers on other broadband and mobile networks are also reporting problems today – that isn't a huge surprise, given how interconnected the UK's broadband and mobile networks are.\nVoxi, which is owned by Vodafone, and Lebara (which is a so-called Mobile Virtual Network Operator that also uses the Vodafone network) are both showing significant spikes in reported issues on Downdetector.\nWe're also seeing spikes on Virgin Media (currently around 1,000 reports) and Sky (about 400 reports), although these may well be a reflection of Vodafone's issues rather than a sign of a wider outage. So far, only Vodafone has stated it officially has issues – if that changes, I'll update this liveblog.\n    October 13, 2025 at 11:53 AM \n## Positive signs?\n     \n(Image credit: Downdetector) There are some potentially promising signs on progress on Downdetector – though the falling number of reports (above) might simply mean large numbers of Vodafone customers have already reported their issues, or simply can't due to their network problems.\nRight now, the number of reports has dropped to 30,845, from a staggering high of about 135,000 (one of the highest I've seen on Downdetector for a UK outage).\nStill, on the TechRadar team, those affected have been without internet or phone service for well over an hour, and there's no word on Vodafone yet on a fix.\nI'll be chasing it up for an answer to see if its engineers have made any progress on an outage that continues to take out its own website...\n   October 13, 2025 at 12:08 PM \n## A double whammy for many\n Vodafone broadband going down across the uk is a great reminder to never have your phone and broadband with the same provider[October 13, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1977754603434168584)\nSee more The worst hit in today's outage, which has now lasted over two hours and counting, are those who are on both Vodafone's broadband and mobile networks.\nUnfortunately, Vodafone makes that a highly tempting proposition with its bundle deals that it says can save you \"up to £400 a year\".\nBut many households are now tethering off other networks, which must be experiencing some significant extra strain. Let's hope Vodafone has an update for us before the demand for evening TV streaming picks up...\n    October 13, 2025 at 12:20 PM \n## What might have caused this?\n     \n(Image credit: Shutterstock) Without any official comment from Vodafone, we can only speculate about what's caused the biggest network outage since [The Great Voice Calling Wobble of July 2025](https://www.techradar.com/news/live/vodafone-ee-o2-outage-july-2025).\nBut Jake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor from the cybersecurity company ESET, says it's still more likely to be an internal i...",

    "metaDescription": "The color of urine can help identify whether a person is hydrated. It can also provide an indication of underlying medical conditions. Learn more here.",
    "content": "Urine colors can change with a person’s health and habits, as well as a urinary tract infection or eating certain foods. Clear urine may mean they drink too much water, while dark brown urine can indicate liver disease. \nUrine color can be a useful indicator of how well-hydrated a person is. Certain foods and medications may also alter urine color. \nSome urine color changes may be a sign of an infection or a problem with the liver or kidneys. This article looks at what different urine colors may mean and when to contact a doctor.\n\n## Urine color chart\nAn illustration by Jason Hoffman.Different colors of urine can indicate different issues or factors. The following sections further explain what certain urine colors may mean. \n\n### Clear or colorless urine\n[Clear urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326740) may be a sign that a person is drinking a lot of water. Doing this [can alter](https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-gb/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/water-balance/overhydration) the balance of electrolytes in the blood.\n[Diuretics](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diuretics), or water pills, increase urine output. People taking these medications may find they urinate more frequently, and their urine may be clear.\n[Diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323627) can also cause people to urinate [more frequentlyTrusted Source](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/signs-symptoms/), as well as feel [very thirsty](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diabetes-thirst). This may lead them to drink more, which can cause clear urine.\n**»Learn more:**[Can a person drink too much water?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318619)\n### Pale or transparent yellow urine\nPale or transparent yellow urine [typically signifies](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/what-color-your-urine-means) that a person is hydrated and drinking enough water.\n[Diabetes insipidus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/183251) is a condition in which the body produces excess urine due to hormonal abnormalities. It [can causeTrusted Source](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/diabetes-insipidus#symptoms) people to pass large quantities of light-colored urine every time they urinate. It can also cause people to feel very thirsty, leading them to drink fluids frequently.\n[Diabetes mellitus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diabetes-mellitus-transmission) can also cause an increase in urine output. This occurs due to sugar excretion in the urine, rather than hormonal imbalances.\n\n### Dark yellow urine\nDark yellow urine [may indicate](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/what-color-your-urine-means) that a person is mildly [dehydrated](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153363). This typically means that they need to drink more water.\nThere is no recommendation regarding how much water a person should drink each day. However, if possible, a person may wish to aim for approximately [6 to 8 glasses](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/) of water per day.\n\n### Orange urine\nLight orange urine may mean a person is slightly dehydrated, so may need to increase their fluid intake.\nCertain [vitamins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878), such as [riboflavin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219561) (vitamin B2), [can also makeTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470460/) urine turn a [bright yellow](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313779) or orange color.\nMedications that may turn urine orange include:\n\n\n- sulfasalazine, an anti-inflammatory drug\n\n- phenazopyridine\n\n- certain laxatives that contain senna\n\n- some [chemotherapy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158401) drugs\n\n- UTI medications\n\n\n### Dark orange or brown urine\nThe [Urology Care Foundation](https://www.urologyhealth.org/healthy-living/care-blog/2018/the-meaning-behind-the-color-of-urine) notes that dark orange or [brown urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324677) can occur if a person is not producing enough urine. This makes the urine they produce more concentrated and darker in color. \nThis may be due to dehydration, strenuous exercise, or being in a hot climate. Drinking more fluids and replacing [electrolytes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153188) may help dilute the urine, which will also make it lighter in color.\nEating large amounts of fava beans can also turn urine a dark brown color.\n[Dark urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324469) may be a sign of a liver problem. A liver problem can cause the body to excrete high levels of bilirubin, a pigment present in bile, which can cause [jaundice](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/165749) and dark urine.\n[High levels of bilirubin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315086) can indicate liver inflammation or other medical conditions associated with the liver.\n\n### Dark brown or black urine\nDark urine may be an indication of a medical condition:\n\n\n- **Liver disease:** Dark urine may be a sign of [liver disease](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/liver-disease-symptoms).\n\n- **Rhabdomyolysis:** Dark brown, dark red, or tea-colored urine may be a sign of [rhabdomyolysis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318224), which is a serious condition that occurs from muscle tissue death.\n\n- **Alkaptonuria:** Also called black urine disease, this is a rare, inherited condition that stops the body from breaking down two types of [amino acids](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324229).\n\n\n### Pink or red urine\nA person’s urine may be pink or red [after eating](https://www.urologyhealth.org/healthy-living/care-blog/2018/the-meaning-behind-the-color-of-urine) certain foods, such as [beetroot](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319447), blackberries, and rhubarb.\n[Blood in the urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324824), or hematuria, may also cause urine to become pink or red. This may occur due to: \n\n\n- [urinary tract infection (UTI)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/189953)\n\n- [prostate infection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322936)\n\n- [kidney stones](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154193)\n\n- urinary tract cancer\n\nIn [some cases](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/h/hematuria), it may be a sign of [kidney disease](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/172179) or [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323648).\nLaxatives that contain senna and phenazopyridine (a drug to treat urinary tract discomfort) can cause urine to turn reddish-orange.\nContacting a healthcare professional about blood in the urine is essential to determine the underlying cause.\n\n### Blue or green urine\nCertain medications or eating foods that contain large amounts of food dye can cause blue or green urine.\n Medications include:\n\n\n- amitriptyline, an [antidepressant](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248320)\n\n- indomethacin, a pain reliever\n\n- propofol, an anesthetic\n\nGreen urine may also indicate a UTI.\n\n### Cloudy urine\n[Cloudy urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324443) may be a sign of a UTI. \nOther symptoms may include: \n\n\n- [foul-smelling urine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/smelly-urine)\n\n- [urinating more frequently](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/70782)\n\n- [pain](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323105), or a burning sensation when urinating\n\n\n### White or milky urine\nChyluria is a condition in which chyle, a milky substance made during digestion, is present in the urine. \nIt [mostly occursTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366404/) due to a [parasitic infection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/220302) that affects the [lymphatic system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/303087) and urinary tract.\n\n### Purple urine\nIn very rare cases, a person [may experience](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/purple-urine-reveals-hidden-infection-woman-2025a100081r?form=fpf) purple urine due to bacterial urinary infections.\n\n## Urine and diabetes\nDiabetes [mayTrusted Source](https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pdi.2167) [increaseTrusted Source](https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pdi.2167) the frequency of urination. It can also increase thirst, and when a person drinks more, this can result in an increased urine output that is paler in color.\nOtherwise, there appear to be no unusual urine color changes for well-managed diabetes.\n\n### When to seek medical help\nDiabetes can increase the risk of UTIs, which can cause cloudy urine. Prompt treatment of a UTI can help prevent complications.\nDiabetes [can increaseTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6264651/) the risk of kidney disease. If people have urine that is consistently darker than usual, appears [foamy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322171) or bubbly, or the amount of urine they produce or the frequency of urination changes, they should contact a healthcare professional.\nPeople will also need to contact a healthcare professional if their urine appears red or brown, as this may be a sign of blood in the urine, which can indicate kidney problems.\n\n## Urine and pregnancy\nPeople may need to urinate [more frequently](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/frequent-urination-during-pregnancy) when pregnant due to hormonal changes and increased pressure on...",

Please disable the KVM kernel extension, recompile your kernel and reboot. (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE).  I'm Running Ubuntu Noble Numbat; I upgraded to this version, so I've not always been running VirtualBox with it. Nevertheless, the last time I used VirtualBox successfully was with Noble Numbat. I am vaguely aware of what KVM is, but I definitely would rather not recompile the kernel if that is avoidable.\n I do use docker, and on occasion multipass, I really don't want to create problems with them by disabling KVM. if there is a way to use VirtualBox with KVM then that would be greatly appreciated, otherwise I'm open to recompiling the linux kernel (if you answer with that please give me a link to or instruction on how to recompile it).\n The host machine is ... really old it's a late 2012 macbook pro, the 4-cores-that-look-like-8 version. Some specs that are relevant.\n \n \n- Cores: 4 cores, but it looks like 8 because each core can run 2 processes (I think).\n \n- Processor: 8 x Intel Core i7-3720QM CPU @ 2.60GHz\n \n- Graphics Processor: NVE7 (I don't have very good GPU drivers, but I don't think that would be the problem)\n \n- Kernel Version: 6.5.0-9-generic (64-bit)\n \n- Hard drive is external (internal one is broken)\n \n- Virtualbox version: 7.0.18r162988\n \n Sometimes Ubuntu will leave old versions of the kernel sitting around that you can choose to use while booting up. I looked into if I could do this and found that Ubuntu didn't leave one this time. I'd love to say that I had done more but I'm pretty clueless about this, and unfortunately I don't really know [VirtualBox error picture](https://i.sstatic.net/19rrtuJ3.png)\n     \n\n- [virtualbox](/questions/tagged/virtualbox)\n\n- [virtual-machine](/questions/tagged/virtual-machine)\n\n- [linux-kvm](/questions/tagged/linux-kvm)\n\n          [Share](/q/1845776)   [Improve this question](/posts/1845776/edit)    Follow            [edited Jun 13, 2024 at 15:17](/posts/1845776/revisions)                asked Jun 13, 2024 at 12:46       [callen44](/users/1977205/callen44)  42311 gold badge33 silver badges55 bronze badges           \n \n- 1 Hi, can you tell us detail about the host of the virtualbox, and the step you try to do to fix it ? – [Maslie](/users/1277488/maslie) [Commented Jun 13, 2024 at 13:54](#comment2921051_1845776)\n \n- Okay, I've added the information. – [callen44](/users/1977205/callen44) [Commented Jun 13, 2024 at 15:19](#comment2921080_1845776)\n \n- And old host, can you check the bios and see if their is an option for virtualization, if the option it's turned off, turn it on and try again – [Maslie](/users/1277488/maslie) [Commented Jun 14, 2024 at 7:34](#comment2921288_1845776)\n \n- 1 Gotta say, I'm a little confused.

A far more robust solution is that @robertspierre to literally tell the system to never load this modules.

This likely means that you cannot run both VirtualBox and KVM at the same time, unless until you re-enable the module:\n # If you are using an Intel CPU sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel # If you are using an AMD CPU sudo modprobe -r kvm_amd  Test if this works first, as this command will only last until your next reboot.

    "content": "# Pokemon Legends: Z-A Basically Confirms All 16 DLC Mega Evolutions\n                    By  [Andrea Trama](/author/andrea-trama/)    Published 3 days ago   Andrea is an editor at Game Rant, where she has been writing professionally about video games for nearly three years. She became a gamer for life at 7, thanks to a copy of Pokemon Red and her Game Boy. As a Destiny 2 and Pokemon fan, Andrea loves games where she's tasked with thinking strategically. When she is not editing, Andrea writes about games she likes and handles the newsletter for Game Rant.                                           Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:                      It's going to be just a few days before ***Pokemon Legends: Z-A*** finally launches this Thursday, October 16, with fans of the previous Legends game and Mega Evolutions as a gimmick possibly getting their dream game. There has been a lot of hype surrounding the game so far, especially after early leaks confirmed there would be 26 new Mega Evolutions in [*Pokemon Legends: Z-A*](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/pokemon-legends-z-a/). Now, despite the game not even being out yet, dataminers have already confirmed the addition of 16 more Mega Evolutions in its upcoming DLC. Even all the actual in-game models for the current Megas have been leaked now, and they are as follows:\n  \n \n- [Mega Clefable](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977629699095625735) (**Fairy/Flying**)\n \n- [Mega Starmie](https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977636805878108424) (Water/Psychic)\n \n- [Mega Meganium](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977086453164409195) (**Grass/Fairy**)\n \n- [Mega Feraligatr](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977508645165228058) (**Water/Dragon**)\n \n- [Mega Skarmory](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977558409152237790) (Steel/Flying)\n \n- [Mega Froslass](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977421934888468736) (Ice/Ghost)\n \n- [Mega Emboar](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977504743363842136) (Fire/Fighting)\n \n- [Mega Excadrill](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977422287277342859) (Ground/Steel)\n \n- [Mega Scolipede](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977587670294683953) (Bug/Poison)\n \n- [Mega Scrafty](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977068617561964988) (Dark/Fighting)\n \n- [Mega Eelektross](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977514145323897274) (Electric)\n \n- [Mega Chandelure](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977558295264243726) (Fire/Ghost)\n \n- [Mega Pyroar](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977422287277342859) (Fire/Normal)\n \n- [Mega Barbaracle](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977554019888533958) (**Rock/Fighting**)\n \n- [Mega Dragalge](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977630316111020255) (Poison/Dragon)\n \n- [Mega Floette](https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1905660094076866962) (Fairy)\n \n- [Mega Zygarde](https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1976412738386788707) (Dragon/Ground)\n \n- [Mega Drampa](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977511532776046862) (Normal/Dragon)\n \n- [Mega Falinks](https://x.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977551910799613959) (Fighting)\n \n   [*Pokemon Legends: Z-A*'s Mega Victreebel](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-lumiose-ghost-girl-mystery/), Mega Dragonite, Mega Chesnaught, Mega Delphox, Mega Greninja, Mega Malamar, and Mega Hawlucha are not included in the list since they were officially revealed before launch.\n             Now, with just three days to the game's release, players have already learned the 16 [new Mega Evolutions coming with *Pokemon Legends: Z-A*'s Mega Dimension DLC](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-early-dlc-reveal-controversy-pre-order/), including the already revealed Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y. The list may change, as the leaks are very recent, but there is a good chance that everything is correct.\n \n##  Every Pokemon Legends: Z-A DLC Mega Evolution Confirmed So Far \n          It's worth noting that [*Pokemon Legends: Z-A*'s Mega Heatran and Mega Darkrai](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-darkrai-heatran-zeraora-leak-confirmed/) were just leaked alongside Mega Zeraora, which was previously believed to have been scrapped. It's unclear if these three Megas will be tied to DLC or post-launch events. Also, these critters are not on the list, as they were already confirmed by the corresponding Mega Stones among the game's items. The current list of DLC Mega Evolutions includes:\n \n \n- Raichu X\n \n- Raichu Y\n \n- Chimecho\n \n- Absol\n \n- Staraptor\n \n- Garchomp\n \n- Lucario\n \n- Golurk\n \n- Meowstic\n \n- Crabominable\n \n- Golisopod\n \n- Magearna\n \n- Scovillain\n \n- Glimmora\n \n- Tatsugiri\n \n- Baxcalibur\n \n This list reported on Twitter by CentroLeaks may seem strange at first, as there will allegedly be new Mega Evolutions for Lucario, Garchomp, and Absol, with the former two being some of the most popular from the original lineup of Megas. Considering that [*Pokemon Legends: Z-A*'s Mega Raichu X and Y](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-raichu-x-y/) further confirm a distinction between X and Y Megas, the DLC may very well add a new Mega for Pokemon that already have one - especially if they are also fan-favorites.\n    \n###  All Possible New Mega Evolutions for Pokemon Legends: Z-A's DLC \n          These 16 [new Megas](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolutions-leak-rumor-official-confirmed/) come with a caveat, though. The original user who reported on this is called HeroOfTimeLink, and they released an update stating that some slots have competition. These are:\n \n \n- Staraptor, but could be Roserade\n \n- Lucario, but could be Hippowdon\n \n- Golurk, but could be Stunfisk\n \n- Golisopod, but could be Palossand\n \n- Alongside Magerna and Zeraora, Marshadow and Melmetal could also get new Megas\n \n- The original list included a new Mega for either Zamazenta or Eternatus, with HeroOfTimeLink believing neither is happening due to these Pokemon not being in the Pokedex\n \n- Scovillain, Glimmora, Tatsugiri, and Baxcalibur could be red herrings, as they do not have corresponding Pokedex data in the game\n \n   Notably, a [Flygon Mega Evolution](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-flygon/) is seemingly out of the picture for the DLC.\n   \n##  8 Out of 16 New Pokemon Legends: Z-A DLC Mega Evolutions Are Already Clear \n      Not counting the slots with competition and the slots that may not get Mega Evolutions at all based on the lack of Pokedex data, only 8 out of the original 16 Megas are confirmed. This doesn't include Mega Heatran, Mega Darkrai, and [Mega Zeraora](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-zeraora-mega-evolution-rumor-dlc/), which are all but guaranteed after their Mega Stones appeared in the game's items, but they may not be part of the DLC itself. If the data is correct, the confirmed Megas at this stage are:\n \n \n- Raichu X\n \n- Raichu Y\n \n- Chimecho\n \n- Absol\n \n- Garchomp\n \n- Meowstic\n \n- Crabominable\n \n- Magearna\n \n Considering that a new Mega Evolution for Absol and Garchomp seems confirmed, it would make sense for Lucario to also get a second one over Hippowdon. On the other hand, Staraptor and Roserade are equally likely, as are Golurk and Stunfisk or Golisopod and Palossand. Still, this narrows things down considerably for what will be included in [*Pokemon Legends: Z-A*'s Mega Dimension DLC](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-za-dlc-rumor-mega-flygon-stones-leaks-bad/).\n                         **        4.0*/10*    [### Pokemon Legends: Z-A](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/pokemon-legends-z-a/)        10 stars  9 stars  8 stars  7 stars  6 stars  5 stars  4 stars  3 stars  2 stars  1 star                                   [RPG](/tag/rpg/) [Adventure](/tag/adventure/)    Systems            [**OpenCritic Reviews**](https://opencritic.com/game/18645/pokemon-legends-z-a)    Top Critic Avg: 81*/100*   Critics Rec: 77%           **Released**    October 16, 2025      **ESRB**    Everyone 10+ / Fantasy Violence, In-Game Purchases      **Developer(s)**    [Game Freak](/tag/game-freak/), Creatures Inc.      **Publisher(s)**    Nintendo, [The Pokemon Company](/tag/the-pokemon-company/)              7 Images                  \n \n- \n \n- \n \n     Where to play **                    [Powered by](https://gamerant.com/db/)            \n \n- [Video Games](/games/)\n \n- [Pokemon Legends: Z-A](/db/video-game/pokemon-legends-z-a/)\n \n- [Pokemon](/tag/pokemon/)\n \n       Follow        Like        Share                 Thread    Sign in to your Game Rant account    We want to hear from you!

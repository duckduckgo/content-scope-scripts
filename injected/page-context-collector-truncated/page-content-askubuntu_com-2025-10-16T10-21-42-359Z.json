Lastly the dpkg command which is the base for all of them.\n Since dpkg is the base, you can use it to install packaged directly from the command line.\n \n### Install a package\n sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE  For example if the package file is called askubuntu_2.0.deb then you should do sudo dpkg -i askubuntu_2.0.deb. If dpkg reports an error due to dependency problems, you can run sudo apt-get install -f to download the missing dependencies and configure everything. If that reports an error, you'll have to sort out the dependencies yourself by following for example [How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/140246/how-do-i-resolve-unmet-dependencies).\n \n### Remove a package\n sudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME  For example if the package is called askubuntu then you should do sudo dpkg -r askubuntu.\n \n### Reconfigure an existing package\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE_NAME  This is useful when you need to reconfigure something related to said package. Some useful examples it the keyboard-configuration when you want to enable the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace in order to reset the X server, so you would the following:\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration  Another great one is when you need to set the Timezone for a server or your local testing computer, so you use use the tzdata package:\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata          [Share](/a/40781)   [Improve this answer](/posts/40781/edit)    Follow            [edited Apr 13, 2017 at 12:23](/posts/40781/revisions)       [Community](/users/-1/community)Bot  1         answered May 6, 2011 at 17:43       [Luis Alvarado](/users/7035/luis-alvarado)  217k172172 gold badges556556 silver badges727727 bronze badges           \n \n- 5 Great info, had to find some way to install traceroute to help debug why my machine won't connect to the internet :) – [Jason](/users/145043/jason) [Commented Nov 20, 2013 at 15:01](#comment485182_40781)\n \n- 37 Also helpful to note that once installed programs are usually found in /usr/bin, named after what was depackaged. – [Chris Moschini](/users/174686/chris-moschini) [Commented Mar 31, 2014 at 9:10](#comment576949_40781)\n \n- If I run sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base, it has failed for months with \"Hash Sum mismatch\".

This allows automatically installing all the dependencies and it does all the extra sanity checks that dpkg will not implement because it's a low level command. Note that without the prefix / or ./ some versions of apt may not understand that you're trying to refer to file name, not a package name from repository. – [Mikko Rantalainen](/users/50254/mikko-rantalainen) [Commented Mar 14, 2023 at 12:18](#comment2552892_40781)\n \n     [Show **3** more comments](#)                218                Debian (.deb) packages are the packages that are used in Ubuntu.

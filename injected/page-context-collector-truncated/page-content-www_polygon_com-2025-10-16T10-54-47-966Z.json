    "content": "Follow         Like    [Thread](#threads)   Link copied to clipboard        By  [Johnny Yu](/author/johnny-yu/)    Published 2 days ago      [Pokemon Legends: Z-A](/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/554934/)   Explore an updated Lumiose City\n  \n# What time does Pokémon Legends: Z-A release?\n     Image: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company, Nintendo              ***[Pokémon Legends: Z-A](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/554934/) ***is the first mainline *Pokémon* game coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on **Oct. 16**.\n In *Pokémon Legends: Z-A*, you'll return to Lumiose City, but, this time, [battles are now experienced in real time](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-battles/). Trainers and Pokémon are free to move around the battlefield and [dish out attacks](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-active-battle-mechanics/) without waiting for the opponent to have a turn. However, trainers around the world will have to wait their turn to get into the game as *Z-A* will be launching at staggered times around the world.\n Here's **when *Pokémon*** ***Legends: Z-A***** will release in your time zone**, and when you can preload the game.\n \n##  Pokémon Legends: Z-A release time in your time zone \n       Image: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company, Nintendo   *Pokémon Legends: Z-A* will be releasing at midnight of your region's easternmost time zone on **Thursday, Oct.16**. For those who live in larger countries, this may be a little confusing, so, to make things a little clearer, here's when *Pokémon Legends: Z-A* will be available in your time zone:\n \n \n- **9 p.m. PDT on Wed. Oct 15** for the west coast of North America\n \n- **12 a.m. EDT** for the east coast of North America\n \n- **12 a.m. BRT** for Brazil\n \n- **12 a.m. BST** for the U.K.\n \n- **12 a.m. CEST **for western Europe\n \n- **12 a.m. JST** for Japan\n \n- **12 a.m. AEDT** for Australia\n \n You can play the game earlier if you swap your account's region to an area in an earlier time zone like New Zealand and Australia, but that will come with a few drawbacks, like unlinking your Nintendo Network ID and potentially being locked out of switching regions. Rather than having to deal with any issues, we'd suggest making an entirely new account in a different region if you want to go this route.\n Of course, this will all only apply if you're purchasing *Pokémon Legends: Z-A* from the eShop. If you're getting a physical copy, you can play as soon as you're able to get one.\n \n##  Can you preload Pokémon Legends: Z-A? \nYes! You can preload *Pokémon Legends: Z-A* now if you've preordered it from the Nintendo eShop. You'll need 4.0 GB of storage space if you're playing on a Switch 1 or 7.7 GB if you're playing on a Switch 2.\n In addition to being able to preload the game, you'll unlock a few preorder rewards. Everyone who preorders *Pokémon Legends: Z-A* will receive a **Ralts holding a Gardevoirite**. For those who purchase digitally, you'll also receive a code in your email for **100 Poké Balls**.\n For those who have preordered a physical copy, your preorder rewards will vary depending on the retailer that you purchased from:\n \n \n- **Pokémon** **Center** — A Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile pin\n \n- **Walmart** — A Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile pin (online preorder only)\n \n- **Target** —*Pokémon Legends: Z-A *decal set\n \n- **Best Buy** — Gamer mat featuring the map of Lumiose City\n \n- **GameStop** — An in-game trench coat and pants set\n \n      \n \n- [Guides](/guides/)\n \n- [Nintendo](/nintendo/)\n \n- [Pokémon Legends: Z-A](/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/554934/)\n \n       Follow        Like        Share                 Thread     We want to hear from you!

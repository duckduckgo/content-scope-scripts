The game revolves around the [sun](/wiki/Sun)'s increasing temperature and [guests](/wiki/Guests) who need [shelter](/wiki/House) from the 𝙸 𝙲𝙰𝙽 𝙵𝙸𝙽𝙰𝙻𝙻𝚈 𝚃𝙰𝙻𝙺𝙺𝙺𝙺! - 𝚆𝚒𝚛𝚎 𝚏𝚊𝚌𝚎. Guests can be humans or [Visitors](/wiki/Visitors) who crawl out from underground with unclear intentions. \nThe first version was published in the [*Violent Horror Stories*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3080380/Violent_Horror_Stories_anthology/%7C) on Steam on August 7, 2024, and a second, more polished [demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3640000/No_Im_not_a_Human_Demo/) was released separately on June 8, 2025. \n \n## Contents\n \n \n- [1 Gameplay](#Gameplay)\n \n- [2 Further details available on other wiki pages](#Further_details_available_on_other_wiki_pages)\n \n- [3 Trivia](#Trivia)\n \n- [4 References](#References)\n \n  \n## Gameplay\n The player must distinguish real people from Visitors pretending to be humans, providing shelter to the former and eliminating the latter. At night, the player chooses guests to let in and can check the window to observe the surroundings. The signs of how to tell a visitor are disclosed to the player at the start of each day. They include: \n \n\n- Perfectly white teeth\n \n- Dirty fingernails\n \n- Bloodshot eyes\n \n- Hairless armpits\n \n- Black patches in aura photos\n \n- Insects inside ears\n \n- Bleeding gums (included in the \"Teeth\" option)\n \n- Skin irritation (included in the \"Hands\" option)\n \n- Rapid eye movement (included in the \"Eyes\" option)\n\n Other signs include: \n \n\n- Blurred photos (only in the [*Violent Horror Stories*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3080380/Violent_Horror_Stories_anthology/%7C) anthology version)\n\n They are checked in a dialog during the daytime. After detecting a correlating sign, the player has an option to point a gun at the guest or hear them out; next, the player can choose what to do with the said person. An [energy bar](/wiki/Energy) tracks how many signs can be inspected each day. There is a variety of [edible items](https://no-i-am-not-a-human.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Edible_Items) that influence this bar: some restore energy for additional checks, while [others](/wiki/Bober_%C4%8Cern%C3%BD) deplete it, letting the player end the day early and go to bed. \nIf the visitors are not eliminated, they kill human guests. Furthermore, [FEMA](/wiki/FEMA) takes guests from the house once in a few days. If the player doesn't let anyone in, it leads to a game over after the visit from the [Intruder](/wiki/Intruder). \n \n## Further details available on other wiki pages\n  \n\n- [Achievements](/wiki/Achievements)\n \n- [Characters](/wiki/Category:Characters)\n \n- [Character Scripts](/wiki/Category:Scripts)\n \n- [Consumable Items](/wiki/Category:Consumable_Items)\n \n- [Endings](/wiki/Endings)\n \n- [Groups and Organizations](/wiki/Category:Groups_and_Organizations)\n \n- [Identification](/wiki/Identification)\n \n- [Locations‎](/wiki/Category:Locations)\n \n- [Mechanics](/wiki/Category:Mechanics)\n \n- [Objects](/wiki/Category:Objects)\n \n- [Terminology](/wiki/Category:Terminology)‎\n \n- [Trioskaz (Game Developer)](/wiki/Trioskaz)\n\n  \n## Trivia\n \n\n- *No, I'm not a human* takes place in post-soviet Russia and is made by Russian developers.\n \n- *No, I’m Not a Human* could possibly be set in Sebezh, Russia, as the village closely resembles one of the shots in the intro. The view shown is [Zamkovaya Gora.](https://imgur.com/a/NR4oTAQ) In reality, no tall buildings are visible from there, but in the game, Khrushchev-era apartment blocks appear in the background. The developers likely used the real view from Sebezh and added those buildings to anchor the story in that setting.\n \n- FEMA in the original Russian language of the game is EMERCOM. EMERCOM is an organization that is similar to FEMA but has a sizable military component. This results in FEMA being incorrectly referred to as military at least once in English translations of the game.\n \n- The developers aren't sure whether to give the player the opportunity to kill [Little Girl](/wiki/Little_Girl) since she's a child. - In the demo, she is the only guest that can't be killed by the player or another guest.\n \n- Datamined files from [*Violent Horror Stories: anthology*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3080380/Violent_Horror_Stories_anthology/%7C) show they were initially planning to make it possible to check a guest's pubic hair on the sixth day to see if they are a Visitor. - This idea was scrapped and replaced by checking armpits in the 2025 demo. - Unlike regular humans, Visitors don't have body hair. - If you speak to the [Delivery Man](/wiki/Delivery_Man) on the 3rd day he delivers something to your house, he will jokingly mention this after talking about his coworker taken by FEMA\n \n- In the game itself with a little chance, you can meet a ghost of a grandmother in the living room sitting on an armchair.\n\n \n## References\n         Categories       Languages      Community content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.   7 Comments\n\n### Join the conversation\nSign in to read what others are saying and share your thoughts.[SIGN IN](/login?metadata=anonymous-article-comments-login-source&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fno-i-am-not-a-human.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNo%2C_I%2527m_not_a_Human_(Game)%3Fautomation%3Dtrue%253Fautomation%253Dtrue%26wait-for-init-args%3Dtrue%26anon-comments-auth-source%3Dlogin%23articleComments)Don't have account?

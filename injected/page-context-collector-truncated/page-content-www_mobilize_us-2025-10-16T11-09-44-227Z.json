    "title": "NO KINGS in Chicago · No Kings",
    "metaDescription": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\n\nHere in Chicago we know how to rise up, fight back, and support each other. It is more important than ever that we do that together on October 18th as we show the nation and the world that Chicago is united in opposing these illegal and unnecessary attacks against our neighbors, our communities, and our democracy. Our actions and resistance are necessary as Trump sends militarized agents into our communities, silences voters and voices, and hands billionaires giveaways while families struggle. \n\nThis isn’t just politics. It’s democracy versus dictatorship. We won’t accept a wannabe king, and we won’t back down in the face of chaos, corruption, and cruelty. Join us in Chicago on October 18th as we join millions of people across the country in a national day of action to declare: No Kings and Hands Off Chicago!\n\nFor answers to questions about the rally and march, including transportation, accessibility, and more, please see our FAQ\n\nHere is the link to the FAQs.  Please hyperlink the words 'see our FAQs': https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8VrVfit4BzhmV52i1u_mlX40BsyBNN3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105623180149769366819&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\n\n_A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events._",

In 1968 Gein was found guilty of murdering a woman, though he also confessed to killing another person. In addition, some believe he murdered his elder brother. Deemed insane, Gein remained in a mental hospital until his death in 1984. He inspired numerous books and [horror films](https://www.britannica.com/art/horror-film), the latter of which include [*Psycho*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Psycho-film-1960) (1960), *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* (1974), and [*The Silence of the Lambs*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs) (1991). In addition, documentaries were created about him, including the [Netflix](https://www.britannica.com/money/Netflix-Inc) docuseries *Monster: The Ed Gein Story* (2025).\n[**](/video/did-you-know-Ed-Gein/-256894)The real serial killer who inspired *Psycho*Learn more about serial killer Ed Gein.[See all videos for this article](/biography/Ed-Gein/images-videos)  \n## Early life\n Gein was the youngest of two children born to Augusta and George Gein. He endured a difficult childhood. His father was an alcoholic, and his domineering mother was verbally abusive. She also frequently warned him about the immorality of women and discouraged friendships with others. Gein nevertheless idolized her, a fact that apparently concerned his elder brother, Henry, who occasionally confronted her in Gein’s presence.\n In 1940 George Gein died from [heart failure](https://www.britannica.com/science/heart-failure), and four years later Henry Gein died in mysterious circumstances during a fire near the family’s secluded farm in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Although Ed Gein reported his brother missing to the police, he was able to lead them directly to the body when they arrived. Despite bruises discovered on the victim’s head, the death was ruled an accident. The death of Gein’s mother in 1945 left him a virtual hermit. In subsequent years, Gein cordoned off the areas of the house that his mother had used most frequently, preserving them as something of a shrine. He supported himself by working as a handyman and occasionally babysitting.\n[Britannica Quiz Famous Serial Killers](/quiz/famous-serial-killers)   \n## Crimes and conviction\n [**](https://cdn.britannica.com/47/222847-050-2FA1CC7B/Ed-Gein-infographic-serial-killer-timeline.jpg)[Ed Gein](https://cdn.britannica.com/47/222847-050-2FA1CC7B/Ed-Gein-infographic-serial-killer-timeline.jpg)An overview of Ed Gein's life and crimes.Gein attracted the attention of the police in 1957, when a hardware store owner named Bernice Worden went missing. Gein had been seen with her shortly before her disappearance, and, when law enforcement officials visited his farm, they found her body hanging by her feet in a shed. She had been fatally shot, [eviscerated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eviscerated), and decapitated. Her head was found in a box.\n Subsequent examinations of Gein’s home showed that he had systematically robbed graves and collected the body parts of women, which he used to make household items and clothing. The [macabre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/macabre) findings included a chair upholstered in [human skin](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-skin), face masks, and boxes of various body parts. He also had created a “woman suit” that he could wear. In addition, authorities discovered the head of Mary Hogan, a tavern operator who had disappeared in 1954. In 1958 Gein’s “house of horrors” was destroyed by fire, the origins of which remain unclear.\n Gein admitted to killing the two women, both of whom allegedly resembled his mother, but pled not guilty by reason of insanity. In late 1957 he was deemed unfit for trial—he had been diagnosed as [schizophrenic](https://www.britannica.com/science/schizophrenia)—and was subsequently [confined](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/confined) in various psychiatric institutions. In 1968, however, after it was determined that he could participate in his own defense, Gein was put on trial. He was found guilty of killing Worden—reportedly due to financial reasons, prosecutors only tried one murder—but then was deemed insane at the time of the [crime](https://www.britannica.com/topic/crime-law). He returned to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death from respiratory failure related to [lung cancer](https://www.britannica.com/science/lung-cancer) in 1984.\n   \n## Books and movies\n Gein’s behavior inspired numerous books and movies, notably three of the most influential horror/thriller films ever made: *[Psycho](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Psycho-film-1960)* (1960), directed by [Alfred Hitchcock](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Hitchcock) and based on Robert Bloch’s powerful 1959 book; *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* (1974), which also drew from the life of Texas serial killer Elmer Wayne Henley; and [*The Silence of the Lambs*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs) (1991), an Oscar-winning [adaptation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adaptation) of Thomas Harris’s best-selling novel (1988). Gein was also the subject of *Monster: The Ed Gein Story*, the third season of the anthology true-crime series. It debuted on [Netflix](https://www.britannica.com/money/Netflix-Inc) in 2025, with [Charlie Hunnam](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlie-Hunnam) in the title role.\n        Access for the whole family!

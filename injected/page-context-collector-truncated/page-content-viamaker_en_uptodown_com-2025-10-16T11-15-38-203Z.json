Ltd.     [4.1](#rating)    36,511 reviews    133.7 M downloads       \n## The official video-editing app from TikTok\n      [### Get the latest version 15.4.0 Oct 16, 2025](https://viamaker.en.uptodown.com/android/download) [Older versions](https://viamaker.en.uptodown.com/android/versions)                                                                                                  Reviewed by  [Andrés López](https://en.uptodown.com/editor/andres-lopez) Content Editor    **CapCut** is a powerful [video-editing](https://en.uptodown.com/android/video-editing-software) tool that manages to do what few other apps of its kind can— combine a wide range of features with incredible ease of use. The result is an app that you can use to create all sorts of high-quality [short videos](https://en.uptodown.com/android/short-videos-apps) in a matter of seconds and then share them on [TikTok](https://tiktok.en.uptodown.com/android), [Instagram](https://instagram.en.uptodown.com/android), and other social media platforms. \nYou don't need a user account to use CapCut. However, although you can use almost all of the app's features without logging in, it's a good idea to link your TikTok account since this makes it possible to send your videos directly to this social media platform and post them right away. It's also important to note that you can't customize your profile or follow other users without a user account. And at the end of the day, this [social](https://en.uptodown.com/android/social) component is an important part of the app.\n \n## Edit templates or create videos from scratch\nAlmost all of the content on CapCut is divided into three tabs. Editing is the first and possibly the one you'll spend the most time on. From here, you can create new [video](https://en.uptodown.com/android/video) projects with a single tap. Simply add as many videos as you want, choosing between those saved to your device's memory or the hundreds of templates at your disposal. Once you've added the videos, you can let your imagination run wild and do whatever you want— cut or copy them, alter the speed with slow motion, add stickers, use special effects, apply image filters, correct brightness and contrast, add text, add music, and much, much more. \n\n## Choose the video's final resolution\nOnce you've finished editing a video, simply choose the quality you want to export, which is 1080p and 30fps by default. These are the default settings, but if you prefer, you can lower the resolution to 720p or 480p, in which case the video will take up less space on your device's memory. You can also do the opposite and export the video in 2K for a truly spectacular resolution. Whatever you do, once the video finishes exporting, you'll be able to find it on your smartphone's memory, after which you can do whatever you want with it. With a tap, you can also upload it to the [cloud](https://en.uptodown.com/android/cloud-storage-apps) to keep the file safe.\n\n## Create videos with community templates\nThe second tab of CapCut is dedicated to various templates created by the community, all of which you can use for your own projects. Typically, you'll see templates that are trending at that moment or those that may interest you based on your style, but you can also take a look at different template categories— [fitness](https://en.uptodown.com/android/fitness-training), velocity, [memes](https://en.uptodown.com/android/meme-games), [artificial intelligence](https://en.uptodown.com/android/ai-art), retro, [collage](https://en.uptodown.com/android/collage-maker), fandom, and more. When you see a template you like, tap the Use Template button, and the app will take you directly to the Editor. From here, you can leave comments on other users' creations and start following them. \n\n## Learn how to use the app with tutorials\nOne of the strengths of CapCut can be found in its third and final tab— Tutorials. From here, you can watch videos created by the app's community, specifically designed to teach you how to use some of the app's more advanced features. Most of these videos are only one minute long and very useful, so learning new tricks on this app doesn't take long. And, once again, if you like a video, you can follow the creator or leave a comment. After all, these types of interactions can encourage content creators, especially if the feedback is constructive.\nCapCut is one of Android's most powerful and versatile video-editing tools. If you want to try editing on [Windows](https://capcut.en.uptodown.com/windows) or [Mac](https://capcut.en.uptodown.com/mac), on the other hand, there are desktop versions of CapCut, too. The vast majority of videos on TikTok, Instagram, and other social media platforms are produced either partially or entirely with this app, and the reason for that is simple— it's easy to use, offers amazing results, and has a large and active community. Without a doubt, this is a must-have app for [content creators](https://en.uptodown.com/android/content-creator) who want to create eye-catching videos on their Android devices.\n   \n## Requirements (Latest version)\n \n \n- Android 6.0 or higher required\n\n     \n## Information about CapCut 15.4.0\n       Package Name com.lemon.lvoverseas    License Free    Op.

With her stunning beauty and exceptional talents, many admire her—yet she rejects all advances with an icy attitude. Minato, however, has little interest in romance due to personal reasons. Even though Rei sits next to him in class and works part-time at the same café, he pays her no special attention. One day, Minato stumbles upon Rei in a back alley, quarreling with a persistent man he recognizes as a customer who had been turned down by her at the café. Acting on impulse, he steps in to help. The very next day after work, Rei unexpectedly appears in the staff room—despite not being scheduled—and suddenly demands a kiss from Minato… Thus begins Minato’s bewildering days, swept up by a slightly offbeat kuudere young lady.

With her stunning beauty and exceptional talents, many admire her—yet she rejects all advances with an icy attitude. Minato, however, has little interest in romance due to personal reasons. Even though Rei sits next to him in class and works part-time at the same café, he pays her no special attention. One day, Minato stumbles upon Rei in a back alley, quarreling with a persistent man he recognizes as a customer who had been turned down by her at the café. Acting on impulse, he steps in to help. The very next day after work, Rei unexpectedly appears in the staff room—despite not being scheduled—and suddenly demands a kiss from Minato… Thus begins Minato’s bewildering days, swept up by a slightly offbeat kuudere young lady.\nNyarotto, Purapura",

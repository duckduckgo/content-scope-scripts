When the craving hits last-minute, the last thing I want to do is wait for the oven to heat up and then spend an hour waiting for the potatoes to bake. The secret? Use your microwave for a perfect “baked” potato in just 7 minutes. The result is just as great as the classic version, in a fraction of the time. Read on below for how to microwave a perfect baked potato, every time.\n\n## How To Microwave A Baked Potato\n\n## INGREDIENTS\n\n\n- **Potato: **For the fluffiest baked potatoes, I like a traditional russet, but you can give any starchy potato the same treatment (even [sweet potatoes](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22565452/microwave-sweet-potato/)!).\n\n- **Butter: **When it comes to potatoes, butter is more than a fat—it's a flavor enhancer. In the company of butter, potatoes taste more like, well, potatoes.\n\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\nBefore your potato is ready for the microwave, it'll need a little prep. First, wash it thoroughly, especially if you like to eat the skin (and why wouldn't you?). Give the potato a thorough scrub under cool running water, using a vegetable brush or your fingers, to get rid of any dirt. Pat the potato dry with paper towels. Now that your potato is squeaky clean, you'll need to prick it all over with a fork—this creates steam vents, which lead to a fluffier texture and prevent a potential explosion in your microwave. This is an important step, so don't skip it!\nPHOTO: TIM RACCA MORRISHCooking times will vary depending on the size of your potato and the power of your microwave, so start by microwaving on high power for 4 minutes. Using tongs (for safety's sake), turn the potato over and continue to microwave for another 3 minutes. At this point, insert a small sharp knife into the center of the potato to check for doneness. If the knife meets no resistance, you're golden. If it's not there yet, continue to microwave, in 1-minute increments, until it's cooked through. Remove the potato from the microwave and let sit for 2 minutes before splitting down the middle; be careful of the hot steam! \n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPHOTO: TIM RACCA MORRISHAt this point, you can take things in whatever direction you like, but I'm partial to the minimalist approach: Hit the potato with a pat of butter and some salt and pepper and you've got something deeply satisfying. \n\nPHOTO: TIM RACCA MORRISH*Full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below.\n*\n\n## Recipe Tips\n\n\n- **How to top your baked potato:** Go easy or go crazy with the [baked potato toppings](https://www.delish.com/cooking/g3210/best-baked-potato-toppings/)—your choice! Just because you've made a meal (or a side) in the microwave doesn't mean it can't be exciting. I like to keep it simple, with a pat of butter, a dollop of sour cream, a pinch of salt and pepper, and some chopped chives. But you can also opt for roads less traveled: [pesto](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a27728075/basil-pesto-recipe/) with freshly grated Parmesan, a smear of miso and a sprinkling of furikake, or a runny [sunny-side-up egg](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a30433849/sunny-side-up-eggs-recipe/) and a drizzle of hot sauce.\n\n- **Oil = crispy skin: **If you want the skin to turn a little crispy, massage the potato with a little bit of oil right before it hits the microwave.\n\n**\n\n## Ingredients\n\n\n- **1** russet potato\n\n- Kosher salt\n\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n\n- Unsalted butter, for serving\n\nSee All Nutritional InformationKeep screen awake\n## You’ll Also Love:\n[How To Microwave Bacon](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a27117027/microwave-bacon/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Twice-Baked Potatoes](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a28437793/twice-baked-potatoes-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Sweet Potato Fries](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a45105079/baked-sweet-potato-fries-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Air Fryer Brussels Sprouts](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35047084/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Sweet Potato Gratin](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a41802674/sweet-potato-gratin-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Grilled Baked Potatoes](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a39504984/grilled-baked-potato-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.delish.com/cooking/a45455472/scalloped-potatoes-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)We've got more[GET THE RECIPES](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/)\n## Directions\nSavePrint\n\n- - Step 1Thoroughly wash potato and pat completely dry.

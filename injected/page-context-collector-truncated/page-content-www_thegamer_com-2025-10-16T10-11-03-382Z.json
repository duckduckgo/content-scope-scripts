    "content": "# Battlefield 6: How To Enable Secure Boot\n                   By  [James Lucas](/author/james-lucas/)    Published 6 days ago   James Lucas is an Executive Editor from Newcastle, England. They have written for sites like IGN, NME, GaymingMag, and VG247, with a special focus on FPS games, Soulslikes, and survival horror.                                                 Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:                       To play [**Battlefield 6**](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/battlefield-6/) and [**Call of Duty: Black Ops 7**](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/) on PC, you need to enable Secure Boot. This provides developers with features that make it harder for hackers to use kernel-level cheats, memory manipulation, spoofing, and other forms of tampering.\n It's a huge help in addressing the rampant cheating problem on PC, but it does present a hurdle for the ordinary player, especially if you're not used to tinkering with your BIOS. If that's you, then here's how you can quickly and easily enable Secure Boot and get stuck into the games you want to play.\n \n##  How To Check If Secure Boot Is Enabled \n           Before we start,** it's worth checking if Secure Boot is already enabled**. You can do this by searching '**Device security**' on Windows, or [opening the 'Help' tab on Steam and selecting 'System Information'](https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-6-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-blops-7-steam-update-secure-boot-system-information/) - both of these will tell you if Secure Boot is on or off.\n \n##  How To Enable Secure Boot \n           If Secure Boot is disabled, then you'll need to **open the BIOS and manually toggle it**. That might seem intimidating given that you're unravelling the innards of your PC, but it's surprisingly simple, and doesn't take long to do.\n      How To Access The BIOS\n                   Search for **Advanced Startup Options** on Windows.\n                 Next to 'Advanced startup', click '**Restart now**'.\n                 Once your PC turns back on, you'll be presented with a few options. Select '**Troubleshoot**', '**Advanced options**', and then '**UEFI Firmware**'.\n   Alternatively, restart your PC and press F2/Del during the start-up.\n                    **You are now in the BIOS**. Each one will look different depending on your manufacturer, but the layout should be roughly the same.\n                 **Select the 'Boot' menu** (sometimes marked by a keybind), and toggle '**Secure Boot state**' to enabled.\n   Some BIOSs also let you search for this option.\n     **Save and quit**, and you'll now be able to access games like Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7.\n           \n \n- [Triple-A Games](/aaa-games/)\n \n- [Battlefield 6](/tag/battlefield-6/)\n \n- [Call of Duty: Black Ops 7](/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/)\n \n       Follow         Like         Share                 Thread     We want to hear from you!

    "content": "# The 10 Best .22LR Handguns For The Money of 2025\n  October 12, 2025 by [Norman Turner](https://thegunzone.com/author/norman-turner/)    Whether you’re new to shooting or an expert marksman, .22-caliber rimfire handguns are among the **most useful firearms you can buy**. Inexpensive, accurate, and low in recoil and report, these pistols and revolvers are the **perfect choice for everything from recreational target shooting to varmint hunting**.\n In my in-depth guide to the Best .22LR Handguns you can buy, I’ll break down 10 of the **best .22-caliber semi-automatic pistols and revolvers** for a variety of applications and tastes, concluding with the best overall.\n   Is this article helpful to you? Yes No \n      So, let’s get started with…\n \n   Table of Contents\n   \n## Why a .22LR Handgun?\n The reasons that gun owners buy handguns chambered in .22 Long Rifle can vary considerably. Although not ideal for self-defense, there are several well-designed firearms chambered in .22LR for this purpose, and I’ll explore some of them in this guide. However, if you decide to buy a .22-caliber pistol for concealed carry, keep in mind that *shot placement* is critical.\n For *target shooting*, whether recreational or competitive, pest control, and varmint hunting, the **.22 Long Rifle cartridge is one of the best calibers on the market**. It’s sufficiently powerful for many sporting purposes, it can prove surprisingly accurate in its best examples, and its recoil is barely noticeable in even the lightest guns.\n It’s also relatively quiet, especially when firing subsonic loads. Add a suppressor, and the gun becomes close to silent. But most of all, it’s *cheap*, so it’s **perfect for plinking — shooting strictly for fun — and training**.\n \n## The 10 Best .22LR Handguns\n  \n \n- [Walther Colt Government Model](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/walther-1911-colt-government-a1-22-lr-sao-12-rounds-5-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR M1911A1\n \n- [Ruger Mark IV Tactical](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/ruger-mark-iv-tactical-22-lr-single-action-10-rounds-4-4-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Pistol for Ease of Disassembly\n \n- [KelTec CP33](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/kel-tec-cp33-22-lr-semi-auto-33-rounds-5-5-barrel-new/) — Best High-Capacity .22LR Handgun\n \n- [Taurus TX22 Competition](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/taurus-tx22-competition-22-lr-semi-auto-16-rounds-5-4-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Handgun for Competitive Shooting\n \n- [Ruger Wrangler](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/ruger-wrangler-22-lr-revolver-6-rounds-4-62-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Handgun Under $300\n \n- [Smith & Wesson Model 317](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/smith-&-wesson-317-kit-gun-22-lr-double-action-8-rounds-3-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Kit Gun\n \n- [Glock 44](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/glock-g44-22-lr-safe-action-10-rounds-4-02-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Handgun for Glock Training\n \n- [Browning Buck Mark](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/browning-buck-mark-plus-camper-22-lr-single-action-10-rounds-6-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Handgun for Ergonomics\n \n- [Ruger LCP II](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/ruger-lcp-ii-22-lr-semi-auto-10-rounds-2-75-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Handgun for Concealed Carry\n \n- [Ruger LCR](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/ruger-lcr-22-lr-double-action-8-rounds-2-barrel-new/) — Best .22LR Revolver for Concealed Carry\n \n  \n **A rimfire take on an old classic…**\n \n### 1 Walther Colt Government Model — Best .22LR M1911A1\n If you’re in love with the fit, feel, and classic silhouette of the M1911 pattern but don’t want to spend money on centerfire ammunition, the Walther Colt is for you.\n The Walther Colt Government Model is an M1911A1-pattern .22LR semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Carl Walther GmbH under license from Colt. Walther offers several variants of this pistol, but the one under review is the *Colt Rail Gun*.\n **Specifications**\n  \n \n- ** Barrel length: 5.0 inches\n \n- ** Overall length: 8.9 inches\n \n- ** Height: 5.5 inches\n \n- ** Width: 1.4 inches\n \n- ** Weight (empty): 34 ounces\n \n- ** Magazine capacity: 12 rounds\n \n  A *modernized* M1911A1, the Walther Colt features an upswept beavertail grip safety and flat mainspring housing, front and rear slide serrations, a skeletonized trigger, and a ring hammer. In addition to the traditional grip safety, there’s also an enlarged manual thumb safety. If you’d like to attach a weapon light or laser, the dust cover has a Picatinny rail. Part of the modern package is a set of low-profile, fixed three-dot combat sights.\n This weapon fulfills the same role as the [Colt Ace](https://www.americanrifleman.org/content/rifleman-q-a-what-was-the-colt-ace/) — *sub-caliber training*. As a full-size M1911A1, the Walther Colt replicates the control placement, grip angle, trigger action, and weight of the full-caliber **Colt Government Model**. The .22LR cartridge provides a low-cost, low-recoil alternative for range practice and familiarization firing.\n **SAO Trigger…**\n Part of the M1911 platform’s appeal is the single-action-only (SAO) trigger, and the Walther Colt trigger has a crisp 5.5-lb break.\n The 12-round single-column detachable box magazine provides **two rounds more than some of the most popular competitors**, such as the Ruger and Browning. The magazine has a vertical slot in the body and a side-mounted button that you can use to lower the follower for easy loading.\n        [See on Guns.com - $439.99](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/walther-1911-colt-government-a1-22-lr-sao-12-rounds-5-barrel-new/)        Pros\n  \n \n- ** Replicates the ergonomics, controls, and sight picture of the centerfire M1911A1.\n \n- ** Dust cover Picatinny rail for attaching accessories.\n \n- ** Crisp 5.5-lb SA trigger.\n \n- ** Durable 12-round detachable magazines.\n \n  \n  Cons\n  \n \n- ** Magazines have sharp edges.\n \n  \n  **The latest iteration of an icon…**\n \n### 2 Ruger Mark IV Tactical — Best .22LR Pistol for Ease of Disassembly\n Sturm, Ruger & Co. introduced the Ruger Standard Model, the company’s flagship .22-caliber pistol, in 1949. In its more than 70-year lifespan, the Standard Model has spawned four variants.\n The Ruger Mark IV is a blowback-operated, hammer-fired, SAO handgun fed from a 10-round magazine. Although gun owners often compare the grip angle, trigger guard, and barrel to those of the Luger P08, Bill Ruger drew inspiration from the 8mm Japanese Nambu.\n **Specifications**\n  \n \n- ** Barrel length: 4.4 inches\n \n- ** Overall length: 8.5 inches\n \n- ** Height: 5.5 inches\n \n- ** Width: 1.2 inches\n \n- ** Weight: 34.6 ounces\n \n- ** Magazine capacity: 10 rounds\n \n  The Ruger Mark IV *Tactical* has a 4.4-inch bull barrel and high-visibility adjustable sights — **ideal for plinking or competitive target shooting**. If you’d prefer to attach an optical sight, the Tactical also features a Picatinny rail on the top of the slide. Instead of a traditional recessed target crown, the muzzle is threaded for a sound suppressor, such as the Ruger Silent-SR, for a *whisper-quiet* shooting experience.\n Despite the popularity of the Ruger Standard Model, one of the most enduring criticisms of the design has been the disassembly procedure — taking the gun apart was a chore.\n **Ruger recently solved this problem in the Mark IV…**\n Takedown is now possible with the press of a button at the rear of the receiver, simplifying routine maintenance considerably. With the button depressed, the barrel–receiver assembly pivots upward, allowing you to easily remove the bolt for cleaning. With the bolt removed, you can access the chamber, cleaning the barrel from the breech to the muzzle.\n        [See on Guns.com - $571.99](https://thegunzone.com/go/gunscom/ruger-mark-iv-tactical-22-lr-single-action-10-rounds-4-4-barrel-new/)        [See on Palmetto State Armory - $549.99](/go/psa/ruger-mark-iv-tactical-22lr-tb-pistol-40150)   \n   Pros\n  \n \n- ** Bull barrel and adjustable sights for target-grade accuracy.\n \n- ** Ergonomic grip angle.\n \n- ** Suppressor compatibility.\n \n- ** Simplified disassembly for cleaning.\n \n  \n  Cons\n  \n \n- ** Stock trigger is unsatisfactory\n \n  \n  **High capacity for plinking fun…**\n \n### 3 KelTec CP33 — Best High-Capacity .22LR Handgun\n In 2011, KelTec unveiled the PMR-30 in .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR), a lightweight, polymer-framed, striker-fired pistol fed from a *30-round magazine*. At the time, this was a significant development in the field of rimfire handguns, especially those chambered in .22 Magnum.\n KelTec’s latest foray into rimfire handguns delivers high capacity in a *.22LR* pistol for extended range sessions.\n **Specifications**\n  \n \n- ** Barrel length: 5.5 inches\n \n- ** Overall length: 10.6 inches\n \n- ** Height: 6.0 inches\n \n- ** Width (at widest point): 1.7 inches\n \n- ** Weight: 24 ounces (unloaded); 29.56 ounces (w/ loaded magazine)\n \n- ** Magazine capacity: 33 rounds\n \n  The aptly named CP33, fed from a *33-round* magazine, is the successor, firing the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The blowback-operated pistol has an SAO trigger and an internal hammer.\n Due to the risk of the case rims interlocking, most rimfire magazines feed from a single column, which limits capacity. KelTec designed a unique “quad-stack” magazine to achieve this firearm’s unusually high capacity without compromising feeding reliability. Unfortunately, this magazine can prove difficult to load.\n In order to cycle a variety of .22 LR loads — subsonic, high, and hypervelocity — the bolt has 5/16 of an inch overtravel.\n **Chargi...",

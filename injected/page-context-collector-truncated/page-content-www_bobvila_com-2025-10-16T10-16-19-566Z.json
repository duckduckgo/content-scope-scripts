You’ll need distilled white vinegar (or lemon juice) and dish soap—a fragrant essential oil is nice to add, but not necessary.\n In this recipe, as with so many other nontoxic homemade cleaners, white [vinegar](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/29-handy-household-uses-for-vinegar-46029/) plays a key role. Its acidity cuts through dirt and grease, an attribute that well equips the window cleaner to remove stuck-on debris and streaks.\n If you’ve washed your windows for years with a commercial cleaner such as [Formula 409](https://www.target.com/p/formula-409-lemon-multi-surface-cleaner-spray-bottle-32oz/-/A-13162353?nrtv_cid=bdb633210efc0f5eafe4e4ac6b345fe33df12b0f33663d47961148795893797a&utm_source=narrativ&ar=1831203886484844849&clkid=18be1ce8Ncb2a11eca956a70ca058b64f&cpng=PTID3&lnm=1036126&afid=Howl%20Technologies%2C%20Inc.&ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002) or even [Windex](https://www.amazon.com/Windex-Original-Window-Cleaner-Bundle/dp/B08SXDQSR9/?tag=bv-serv-homemade-window-cleaner-20&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobvila.com%2Farticles%2Fhomemade-window-cleaner%2F&ascsubtag=0000BV0000059675O1280072020251016101606_8bYYx3JjgMtCxR%7E17606097%7E0%7Epilmh6%7E1rpbb2y), it’s likely that the glass sports a subtle, waxy film. That residue comes off easily with ordinary dish detergent, another ingredient contributing to the efficacy of homemade window cleaner.\n \n### Step 2: Combine the homemade glass cleaner ingredients and dilute them with warm water.\n Photo: Tom Fenenga for Bob Vila In a spray bottle, combine ¼ cup of white vinegar with ½ teaspoon of liquid dish soap. Dilute the solution with 2 cups of water, then shake the bottle vigorously to mix the components. If you don’t have white vinegar on hand, you can substitute [lemon juice](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/20-clever-household-uses-for-lemons-46313/). Like distilled white vinegar, lemon juice has a mild acidity that cuts through grease and grime with equal panache.\n \n### Step 3: Add essential oil for fragrance (optional).\n Photo: Tom Fenenga for Bob Vila As a cleaning agent, there’s much to love about vinegar, but the strong odor isn’t everyone’s favorite thing. Fortunately, you can go a long way toward camouflaging the scent of your homemade glass cleaner by adding essential oil to the mixture in the spray bottle. Pick your favorite oil and add 10 to 15 drops.\n With your homemade window cleaner now ready, spray the window glass with it. Then, using a lint-free cloth such as a [microfiber towel](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/best-microfiber-cloth/) or chamois, wipe the cleaner across the entire surface you’re cleaning. The cleaner will dry fairly quickly, leaving behind a streak-free shine. For best results, follow up with a window squeegee, like the highly rated [Mr. Siga window cleaning squeegee and scrubber](https://www.amazon.com/MR-SIGA-Professional-Window-Cleaning-Combo/dp/B06VXLQ31Z/?tag=bovi01-20&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobvila.com%2Farticles%2Fhomemade-window-cleaner%2F&ascsubtag=0000BV0000059675O1280072020251016101606_8bYYx3JjgMtCxR%7E17606097%7E0%7Epilmh6%7E1niu6gy).\n \n## What Do the Ingredients Do?\n This window-cleaning recipe works like a dream, but what do the individual components contribute to the mix? We’ll break it down for you.\n \n### Vinegar\n The main reason distilled white vinegar makes such a good glass cleaner is because it contains acetic acid. The colorless organic compound gives white vinegar its pungent flavor and odor, and kills some bacteria. When you wash windows with vinegar, not only will you be able to break down and remove dirt, grease, and mineral deposits, you’ll also be able to kill germs on hard surfaces around the home.\n It is important to note, however, that vinegar-based cleaning solutions should not replace true sanitizing cleaners that remove 99.9 percent of disease-causing bacteria and viruses, the [EPA standard](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/interim-guidance-review-products-adding-residual-efficacy-claims) for products labeled as sanitizers.\n \n### Lemon Juice\n Photo: iStock  Like white vinegar, the acids in [lemon](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/20-clever-household-uses-for-lemons-46313/) juice can effectively break down grime on glass surfaces such as windows. The citric acid found in lemon juice is technically a bit stronger than vinegar’s acetic acid, though both are about equally effective when it comes to cleaning around the house.\n \n### Dish Soap\n Several ingredients make up most liquid dish soaps on the market, but one ingredient in particular, sodium lauryl sulfate, gives dish soaps their impressive grease-busting abilities. The component bonds with oily particles and lifts them off of surfaces, which allows for easy removal when used with water.\n \n### Essential Oils\n Photo: iStock istockphoto.com The best homemade window cleaner leaves behind an appealing scent. Many [essential oils](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/surprising-household-item-uses-2023/) contain natural chemical components that are both cleansing and pleasantly scented. Tea tree essential oil, for example, doesn’t just smell great—it has antibacterial, antiseptic, and antifungal properties. Mixing it into your homemade window cleaner can help prevent mold and mildew growth, too.\n \n### **Warm Water**\n As is the case when cleaning other parts of the home, water temperature mak...",

And when you sell an asset for less than its original value, the money you lose is known as a capital loss. \nThe difference between your capital gains and your capital losses is your net profit. For example, if you sold a stock for a $10,000 profit this year and sold another at a $4,000 loss, your net capital gain is $6,000.\nMost items people own are considered capital assets. This can include investments, such as stocks, bonds, cryptocurrency or real estate, as well as personal and tangible items, such as cars or boats. \n» MORE: [How to find a financial advisor who can help](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-find-a-financial-advisor-near-you)\nADLife is messy.Make a financial planNerdWallet Wealth Partners builds personalized financial plans and investment strategies, helping you control what you can and prepare for what you can’t.\n[SCHEDULE A CALL](https://nerdwalletwealthpartners.com/find-your-advisor?utm_source=nerdwallet&utm_term=%2Farticle%2Ftaxes%2Fcapital-gains-tax-rates&ajs_anonymous_id=eae02bce-5882-417b-93ec-f04185e97840&utm_medium=nw_wealth_partners_cta)on NerdWallet Wealth Partners' website. For informational purposes only. NerdWallet Wealth Partners does not provide tax or legal advice.\n\n## What is capital gains tax?\nCapital gains taxes are owed on profits made from the sale of assets. How much you pay depends on what you sold, how long you owned it before selling, [your taxable income](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/taxable-income) and your filing status. Capital gains can be subject to either short-term tax rates or long-term tax rates. \nSome exceptions:\n\n\n- High-earning individuals may also need to account for the [net investment income tax](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/net-investment-income-tax) (NIIT), an additional 3.8% tax that can be triggered if your income exceeds a certain limit.\n\n\n\n- Long-term capital gains on so-called “collectible assets” can be taxed at a maximum of 28%. This includes items such as coins, precious metals, antiques and fine art. Short-term gains on such assets are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate[1].\n\n»MORE: [Calculate your capital gains tax](https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/capital-gains-tax-calculator)\n\n## What is long-term capital gains tax?\nProfits from the sale of an asset held for more than a year are subject to long-term capital gains tax. The long-term capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on taxable income and filing status. Per the IRS, most people pay no more than 15%[2].\n\n## What is short-term capital gains tax?\nShort-term capital gains tax is a tax on profits from the sale of an asset held for one year or less. Short-term capital gains are treated as regular income and taxed according to ordinary income tax brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% or 37%.\n» MORE: [See which tax bracket you're in](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets)\nNerd tip \nCapital gains taxes apply to assets that are \"realized,\" or sold. This means that the returns on stocks, bonds or other investments purchased through and then held within a brokerage are considered unrealized and not subject to capital gains tax. \nBut one important caveat is investments that produce dividends. Even if you haven't sold a dividend stock or other dividend investment, the income you receive from the [dividends may be considered a capital gain](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/dividend-tax-rate).\nAssets held within tax-advantaged accounts — such as 401(ks) or IRAs — aren't subject to capital gains taxes while they remain in the account. Instead, you may pay regular income taxes when it comes time to make a qualified withdrawal, depending on what type of account it is.\n» Ready to see the whole picture?

Our capital gains tax calculator shows how much that could save.\n» Dive deeper: [See when to make estimated tax payments](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/estimated-quarterly-taxes)\n\n### 2. Use tax-advantaged accounts\nThese include [401(k) plans](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-a-401k), individual retirement accounts and 529 college savings accounts, in which the investments grow tax-free or tax-deferred. That means you don’t have to pay capital gains tax if you sell investments within these accounts. [Roth IRAs](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-a-roth-ira) and [529 accounts](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/529-plan-rules), in particular, have big tax advantages. If you follow the account rules, you can withdraw money from those accounts tax-free. With traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, your money grows tax-deferred, then you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement.\n\n### 3. Rebalance with dividends\nRather than reinvest dividends in the investment that paid them, rebalance by putting that money into your underperforming investments. Typically, you'd rebalance by selling securities that are doing well and putting that money into those that are underperforming. But using dividends to invest in underperforming assets will allow you to avoid selling strong performers, and thus avoid the capital gains that would come from that sale.\n» MORE: [Learn about the dividend tax rate and how it works](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/dividend-tax-rate)\nADLife is messy.Make a financial planNerdWallet Wealth Partners builds personalized financial plans and investment strategies, helping you control what you can and prepare for what you can’t.\n[SCHEDULE A CALL](https://nerdwalletwealthpartners.com/find-your-advisor?utm_source=nerdwallet&utm_term=%2Farticle%2Ftaxes%2Fcapital-gains-tax-rates&ajs_anonymous_id=eae02bce-5882-417b-93ec-f04185e97840&utm_medium=nw_wealth_partners_cta)on NerdWallet Wealth Partners' website. For informational purposes only. NerdWallet Wealth Partners does not provide tax or legal advice.\n\n### 4. Look into tax-loss harvesting\nThe IRS taxes your net capital gain, which is simply your total long- or short-term capital gains (investments sold for a profit) minus the corresponding long- or short-term total capital losses (investments sold at a loss). The strategic practice of selling off specific assets at a loss to offset gains is called [tax-loss harvesting](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/tax-loss-harvesting). This strategy has many rules and isn't right for everyone, but it can help to reduce your taxes by lowering the amount of your taxable gains.\nIf your net capital loss ...",

The way eDreams handles this subscription is extremely misleading and reflects a bad business strategy approach. I was charged for the eDreams Prime subscription without giving clear consent after the trial period ended. When I contacted customer service, they were trying to refuse to issue a refund and instead offered a £90 voucher, which is completely unacceptable. Under the UK Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, customers have the right to cancel within 14 days of renewal and receive a full refund. eDreams should respect this legal right and treat customers fairly. Offering vouchers instead of refunds and making the cancellation process unclear damages trust and discourages repeat customers. This is a very poor business practice and shows a short-sighted approach to customer relationships. I strongly recommend others to avoid signing up for eDreams Prime unless you intend to use it long-term — and even then, read the fine print carefully.](reviews/68ef4ebd8d4267054a24bc22)[### eDreams www.edreams.com](review/www.edreams.com)[### Mike Smith](users/665ae6e73a3109243861787b)[### Bought Hisense fridge freezer from AO, first day the ice maker or water dispenser didn't work, rang Hisense and they sent out a repair person.

When I contacted customer service, they were trying to refuse to issue a refund and instead offered a £90 voucher, which is completely unacceptable.\n\nUnder the UK Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, customers have the right to cancel within 14 days of renewal and receive a full refund. eDreams should respect this legal right and treat customers fairly.\n\nOffering vouchers instead of refunds and making the cancellation process unclear damages trust and discourages repeat customers. This is a very poor business practice and shows a short-sighted approach to customer relationships.\n\nI strongly recommend others to avoid signing up for eDreams Prime unless you intend to use it long-term — and even then, read the fine print carefully.",

They said they would have to order parts. After 10 weeks and numerous phone calls we was told the parts can't be found and a repair eta could not be given. Went back to hisense and they said the policy is to wait for parts and could not issue refund until parts eta was confirmed. We was told we had to just wait for parts which is unacceptable. As we had not involved AO at this point we went back to them as we had bought it through them and within 10 minutes they had got onto hisense and got them to issue refund, we obviously didn't get another hisense. Would never buy there products again. Poor poor customer service",

Potatoes are delicious any way they're cooked, but one of the easiest ways to prepare them is simply baking them in the oven. Sure, you can microwave a potato or even [air fry a baked potato](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/a46043388/air-fryer-baked-potato-recipe/), but the fool-proof oven method is hard to beat. \nAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowBaked potatoes have a crispy skin and fluffy interior, and only need a pat of butter and a sprinkle of salt to turn them into a delicious side dish. But don't be afraid to get creative with your toppings. Sprinkle your potato with crispy bacon bits, shredded cheese, and sour cream, or turn your potato into an entire meal! Ree Drummond's [Buffalo chicken baked potatoes recipe](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a33548925/buffalo-chicken-baked-potatoes-recipe/) is a game day winner and the steak- and creamed spinach-stuffed [steakhouse baked potatoes recipe](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a43099614/steakhouse-baked-potatoes-recipe/) may just be the best dinner ever.\nWhen it comes to making baked potatoes in the oven, the process is simple. All you need is the right [type of potato](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/cooking-tips-tutorials/a36857405/types-of-potatoes/) (russet is best) and some oil. They'll bake in the oven—without any foil we might add—in just about an hour. Once you have the method down, you can get as creative as you like. Try these recipes for [BLT baked potatoes](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a32627104/blt-baked-potatoes-recipe/), [twice baked potatoes](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a11731/twice-baked-potatoes/), or even [baked sweet potatoes](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a37942348/baked-sweet-potato-recipe/). You'll want to eat potatoes every night of the week!\n\n**How do you prep potatoes for baking?**\nYou'll want to give the spuds a good scrub down to remove and dirt and debris before beginning. Dry the potatoes, then prick them with a fork. This creates tiny holes that allow steam to escape so your potato doesn't burst open in the oven (and make a mess!). \n**Is it better to bake a potato at 350 or 400 degrees?**\nTo get a nice, fluffy interior and the crispiest skin, bake your potatoes at 400 degrees. It'll take about an hour. \n**Is it faster to bake a potato in foil?**\nTechnically, it could decrease the cook time a little bit, but it's not worth it. Trust us! Wrapping potatoes in foil produces a soggy potato because the foil holds in moisture and steams the potato. This recipe calls for cooking the potatoes on a baking sheet (or even directly on the oven rack) for evenly cooked potatoes with perfectly crisp skin.\n**Should baked potatoes be oiled?**\nYou don't *have* to oil your potatoes, but it's a good idea. The oil helps to crisp up the skin! You can brush the potatoes with melted butter instead of oil if you prefer.\n**What type of potato is best for baking?**\nThe best potatoes for baking are those that are low in moisture and high in starch, like a russet or an Idaho potato. Waxier potatoes like Yukon golds or red-skinned potatoes won't result in a fluffy center when baked.********\n********How long should you bake a potato for?****\n********Depending on the size, 50 minutes to 1 hour at 400 degrees should do the trick and result in perfectly fluffy flesh with crispy skin.\n\n**Can you overcook a baked potato?**\nYes, it is possible to bake a potato for too long. Overcooked potatoes will be dry and crumbly and will have wrinkly skin. To avoid overcooked potatoes, check the potato for doneness around the 1 hour mark. \n**How can you tell if a baked potato is done?**\n****Once your timer goes off, you can check to see if your potato is done by piercing it with a paring knife—it should slide in easily. You can also give the potato a squeeze (with oven mitts on!) to feel if it's soft. \n\n## Ingredients\n\n\n- **4** baking potatoes (such as russets)\n\n- **1** **1/2** **Tbsp.** canola oil\n\nSee Nutritional InformationKeep screen awake\n## You’ll Also Love:\n[Baked Sweet Potato](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a37942348/baked-sweet-potato-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Smashed Potato Salad](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a65173815/smashed-potato-salad-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[How to Roast Potatoes Like a Pro](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/cooking-tips-tutorials/a32067554/how-to-roast-potatoes/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Air Fryer Baked Potato](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/a46043388/air-fryer-baked-potato-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Sweet Potato Pie](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a44702938/sweet-potato-pie-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Twice Baked Potato Casserole](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a37598987/twice-baked-potato-casserole-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)[Air Fryer Potatoes](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a37975485/air-fryer-potatoes-recipe/?itm_source=parsely-api)We've got more!![GET THE RECIPES](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/)\n## Directions\nSavePrint\n\n- - 1Preheat the oven to 400˚F.

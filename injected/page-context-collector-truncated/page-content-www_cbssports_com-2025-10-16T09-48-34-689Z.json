The late window was particularly eventful as a few top-25 teams narrowly avoided upsets against unranked foes. \nAll but No. 15 Michigan, at least. The Wolverines dropped to 4-2 on the year in a 31-13 loss to USC. The Trojans, who lost each of their top two running backs fairly early into the evening's proceedings, still rushed for 232 yards and two touchdowns against Michigan's defensive front. Walk-on running back King Miller led the way with 158 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. \nAt around the same time, No. 10 Georgia and No. 11 LSU were pushed to the limit by SEC foes. The Bulldogs scored a late touchdown to eek out a 20-10 win against rival Auburn while LSU kicked a short field goal to collect its own 20-10 victory over an upset-minded South Carolina squad. \nMichigan wasn't the only ranked team to fall to an opponent outside of the top 25. No. 6 Oklahoma's season hit its first major road bump as the Sooners lost 23-6 to Texas in a Red River rout. \nTaking other ranked wins like No. 1 Ohio State's triumph over No. 17 Illinois and No. 7 Indiana's statement-making victory against No. 3 Oregon into account, there's sure to be major shifts in both top 25 polls Sunday. \nCBS Sports had you covered with recaps and analysis from all of Week 7's most impactful games. \n\n## College football scores, schedule: Week 7\nNo. 1 Ohio State 34, No. 17 Illinois 16 --

 Georgia survives scare against Auburn \n  \n### Final: No. 10 Georgia 20, Auburn 10 \nEverything was going right for Auburn in its upset bid against rival Georgia. Until it wasn't. Late in the second quarter, Auburn had a chance to go up three possessions with a 10-0 lead and the ball on Georgia's 1-yard line. Then quarterback Jackson Arnold fumbled on what should have been a routine sneak play for a touchdown. \nGeorgia recovered that fumble and turned it into its first three points of the game. The Bulldogs rode that momentum to a 17-0 scoring advantage in the second half and 20 unanswered points to escape the upset. The Bulldogs officially slammed the door near the start of the fourth quarter when they embarked on a 16-play, 78-yard drive that took 8:45 off the clock and ended with a 10-yard touchdown from quarterback Gunner Stockton. \nStockton's score gave Georgia a two-possession lead and officially put the game out of reach. \n           [Will Backus](/writers/will-backus/)      Oct. 11, 2025, 11:31 pm EDT                \n##  LSU shuts door on South Carolina \n  \n### FINAL: LSU 20, South Carolina 10\nDespite a couple red zone turnovers from Garrett Nussmeier, the 11th-ranked Tigers avoided the home upset with an impressive performance defensively against a team that's sputtering this season under Shane Beamer. Nussmeier's go-ahead touchdown pass to a streaking Kyle Parker over the middle in the third quarter was the decisive blow for the Tigers, who improved to 19-2-1 all-time against the Gamecocks.\nLSU managed a season-high five sacks and six tackles for loss, harassing a South Carolina offensive line that struggled throughout. The Gamecocks were penalized 13 times and lost for the third time in four contests this fall against SEC competition.\n           [Brad Crawford](/writers/brad-crawford/)      Oct. 11, 2025, 11:26 pm EDT                \n##  No. 9 Texas Tech handles Kansas with ease \n  \n### FINAL: No. 9 Texas Tech 42, Kansas 17\nFor most of the top teams in college football, nothing came easy this weekend. Then there's Texas Tech, which continues to handle its business without breaking too much of a sweat.\nThe Red Raiders only needed 133 passing yards because they got whatever they wanted on the ground. Texas Tech shredded the Kansas defense for 372 rush yards, and running back Cameron Dickey led the way with 263 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n     As good as Texas Tech's run game was, the defense was equally impressive. That unit notched eight sacks while forcing a f...",

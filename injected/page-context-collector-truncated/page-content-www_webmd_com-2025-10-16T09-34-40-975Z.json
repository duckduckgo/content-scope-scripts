But a drug can bring on problems if it doesn't mix well with something else you put into your body, like another medication, a certain food, or [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts).\nWhen that happens, it's called a [drug interaction](https://www.webmd.com/interaction-checker/default.htm). It could make your medication stop working, become less effective, or too strong. It could also trigger side effects.\nThe more you learn about drug interactions, the better you'll be able to avoid them. Here's what you need to know.\n\n## What Are the 3 Types of Drug Interactions?\nThe main types are:\n**Drug-drug interaction**. This is when a medication reacts with one or more other drugs. For example, taking a [cough medicine](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cough-syrup-cough-medicine) ([antitussive](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-54333-antitussive+oral.aspx)) and a drug to help you [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm) (sedative) could cause the two medications to affect each other.\n**Drug-food/drink interaction**. This is when something you eat or drink affects a drug. For instance, it can be dangerous to drink alcohol while you're on certain medications. Some [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) and [dietary supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-faq) interact with medicines, too.\n**Drug-condition interaction**. This is when you have a health problem that makes it risky for you to take certain meds. For example, if you have a condition like [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm), taking a [decongestant](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) for a [cold](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm) could drive up your [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers) even more.\n\n## What Drugs Can You Not Take Together?\nThere are many types of drugs you shouldn't take together, but in general, don't take combinations like these:\n**Two or more drugs that share an active ingredient.** You could have side effects or an [overdose](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/drug-overdose). Active ingredients are the chemicals in medications that treat your condition or symptoms. Always check for them on the drug label.\n**Blood-thinning drugs with [NSAIDs](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/features/pain-relief-how-nsaids-work)**. Your odds for a dangerous bleed could go up. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are pain relievers like [ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9368-IBUPROFEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5166&drugname=ibuprofen+oral) or [naproxen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-1289-NAPROXEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5173&drugname=Naproxen+Oral). If you're on a blood thinner, ask your doctor to suggest a different type of over-the-counter pain medication and dose that's safer for you.\n**Pills that cause sedation.** Taking multiple medicines that cause sleepiness can reduce your alertness and reflexes. This can reduce your ability to safely drive or do other activities that need your full attention. In some cases, they can reduce your breathing or stop it altogether. Common medicines that cause sedation are allergy medicines (antihistamines), sleep medicines, anxiety medicines called benzodiazepines, and some prescription pain medicines. Alcohol can also cause sedation.\nSome other drug-drug combinations that can be dangerous are:\n\n\n- An NSAID pain reliever with a blood pressure drug\n\n- A thyroid drug called [levothyroxine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1433/levothyroxine+oral/details) with an acid-blocking proton pump inhibitor drug called [omeprazole](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3766/omeprazole+oral/details)\n\n- An [SSRI](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-medications-antidepressants) antidepressant with another medicine that affects serotonin (such as [dextromethorphan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-77506-dmax+oral.aspx), [linezolid](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-6154-LINEZOLID+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=18168&drugname=linezolid+oral), tramadol, and [trazodone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11188/trazodone+oral/details))\n\n- A cholesterol-lowering [statin](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/video/should-i-take-a-statin) with antifungal and fibrate meds that are commonly called \"azole\" drugs (Their technical names are \"imidazole and triazole derivatives.\" They lower blood fats called [triglycerides](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/lowering-triglyceride-levels).)\n\n- The antibiotic clarithromycin with a type of blood pressure drug called a calcium channel blocker\n\n\n## What Are Common Drug Interactions?\nCertain foods and drinks don't mix well with some medications. A few of these are:\n**Alcohol**. Booze can bring on dangerous side effects with many medications, including some drugs for:\n\n\n- [Allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/default.htm)\n\n- Cold and flu\n\n- [High cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/default.htm)\n\n- High blood pressure\n\n- [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/default.htm) (ADHD)\n\n- [Depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm)\n\n- [Diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm)\n\n- Infections\n\n- [Pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm)\n\n- Poor sleep\n\nBefore you start a new medication, ask your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions) if it could interact with alcohol. Check the drug label for alcohol warnings, too.\n**Grapefruit or grapefruit juice.** Too much of either can affect some drugs like:\n\n\n- [Statins](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/side-effects-of-statin-drugs)\n\n- [Antihistamines](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies)\n\n- [Blood pressure drugs](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/how-take-blood-pressure-medicine-properly-why-you-should)\n\n- [Anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm) meds\n\n- Transplant anti-rejection drugs\n\nGrapefruit juice doesn't mix badly with every type of drug in these classes of medications. Check your drug's label or information pamphlet for any warnings about it. Also, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it's safe to have grapefruit or its juice in any amount with your specific drug. If they tell you to stop eating or drinking it, ask if any other fruits or juices might have similar effects on your medicine.\n**[Foods with vitamin K](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-vitamin-k)**, like leafy [greens](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-greens). These can interact with the [blood thinner](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ss/slideshow-tips-for-taking-blood-thinners) warfarin. You don't have to stop eating them, but it's important to be consistent and not overdo it. Ask your doctor how much food with vitamin K you can have, then eat the same amount around the same times each week.\n**High-[potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium) foods and drinks**, like bananas, salt substitutes, and orange juice. These can affect blood pressure drugs called [ACE inhibitors](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/medicine-ace-inhibitors). Your doctor will track your potassium levels, and they may tell you to cut back on foods with it.\n**St. John's wort**. This herbal dietary supplement can affect many medications for heart disease, [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/default.htm), [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics), and other conditions. It can also affect [birth control pills](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills) and the [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm) drugs [irinotecan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-13700-irinotecan+iv.aspx) and [imatinib](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-20983-imatinib+oral.aspx).\nAlways get your doctor's or pharmacist's OK before you try a new supplement. It's also possible for a medication you take to interact with a health condition you have. Some common drug-condition interactions happen between:\n\n\n- Antacids and [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information)\n\n- Antihistamines and certain [breathing problems](https://www.webmd.com/lung/breathing-problems-causes-tests-treatments), [glaucoma](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes), and [enlarged prostate](https://webmd.com/men/prostate-enlargement-bph/default.htm)\n\n- Asthma rescue inhaler...",

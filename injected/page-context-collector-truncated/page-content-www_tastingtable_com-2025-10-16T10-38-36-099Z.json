Despite common misconceptions, lactose intolerance does not necessarily mean you must entirely cut cheese out of your diet. Several types of cheese contain little to no lactose. A general guideline is that hard and aged cheeses are lower in lactose than cheeses that are soft and fresh, but we've done the research to take away some of the guesswork. \n There are two common ways to measure lactose levels in cheese: grams per serving and percentages when you are searching for a cheese that is right for you. According to [t](https://dairynutrition.ca/en/nutrition-and-health/lactose-intolerance/lactose-intolerance-health-authorities-recommendations)he [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/lactose-intolerance/eating-diet-nutrition), most lactose intolerant people can consume 12 grams of lactose in a serving, which is equivalent to 1 cup of milk. When lactose amounts are listed in percentages, it is referring to the percent of lactose by weight, correlating to how many grams of lactose would be found in 100 grams of that dairy product, as shown on [Lacteeze](https://www.lacteeze.com.au/about-lactose-intolerance/lactose-content-of-common-food/).\n Keep in mind, there's no hard rule that applies to everyone, so be mindful of what works for you and that you overdo it! As long as average-sized servings of low-lactose cheeses are consumed, lactose-intolerant individuals are free to welcome the following cheesy goodness back into their diets.\n    \n## Colby cheese\n       Scott Olson/Getty Images   Colby cheese, like cheddar, is a solid yellow/orange cheese. According to [Wisconsin Cheese](https://www.wisconsincheese.com/the-cheese-life/article/109/colby-cheese), Colby cheese was created in Colby, Wisconsin, by Joseph Steinwand, a cheddar maker who was experimenting to see how changes to the cheddar-making process would change the taste and texture of the resulting cheese. To make Colby cheese, the site says that the followed the normal cheddar-making process, but then washed his cheese curds in cold water, pressed them, and aged them anywhere from one to three months; this made it less acidic and, therefore, milder and sweeter than a traditional cheddar would be. A regular [Colby is not to be confused with Colby Jack](https://www.tastingtable.com/1084598/colby-jack-vs-colby-whats-the-difference/), which is a marbled cheese made by combining bits of Colby cheese and bits of Monterey Jack cheese.\n Because Colby is a hard cheese and an aged cheese, it naturally has very little lactose in it. While couldn't find specifics on the exact amount of lactose in pure Colby cheese, it contains a minimal amount of lactose, which is washed away when the cheese curds are rinsed, and the overall content continues to drop during the months that it sits aging.\n    \n## Cheddar cheese\n       Mironov Vladimir/Shutterstock   Whether white or yellow, sharp or mild, cheddar cheese is a staple of the cheese world. From grilled cheese and mac and cheese to soups and omelets, cheddar cheese can be found in countless delicious dishes. Some may say it's basic and maybe even too simple, while others maintain that its wide accessibility and popularity are for a good reason.\n One thing [you may not know about cheddar cheese](https://www.mashed.com/485895/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cheddar-cheese/) is that the name comes from a village in England where it was first created when a milkmaid left milk in a cave and came back to find it partially solidified. However, the cheddar cheese we eat today does not have to come from Cheddar at all; in fact, it is often produced in the United States. Because there is no strict definition of what makes cheddar cheese \"cheddar,\" its variations are usually described using color and sharpness indicators, with sharpness being far more important for determining the taste. Generally, the sharper a cheddar is described to be, the longer it has aged and the stronger its taste will be. \n Whether sharp or mild, all cheddar cheese has relatively low levels of lactose, and 1 ounce of sharp cheddar cheese contains about 0.4 to 0.6 grams of lactose (via [UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PI%2F55938)). In contrast to one cup of milk, cheddar cheese is clearly better suited for someone with lactose intolerance.\n    \n## Swiss cheese\n       Katarzyna Hurova/Shutterstock   When you think of swiss, you probably think of a slice or chunk of cheese that is white in color with many holes throughout it. Of course, this is not the only type of cheese that comes from Switzerland. Other popular types of cheese, such as [gruyère](https://www.tastingtable.com/1105171/the-absolute-best-type-of-wine-to-pair-with-gruyere/), also originate from Switzerland but are not referred to as \"swiss cheese\" in the United States. The type of cheese that is labeled as [\"swiss cheese\"](https://www.tastingtable.com/1079661/the-origins-of-swiss-cheese/) is actually an American take on a type of cheese from Switzerland called emmental. Swiss cheese came to the U.S. when Swiss immigrants tried to recreate their beloved emmental as similarly as possible in their new homeland. Swiss cheese produced in America is very similar to emmental but is usually a bit milder in flavor.\n Swiss cheese, like many of the cheeses on this list, is an aged cheese with only 0.04 grams per 40 grams, which makes it great for lactose-intolerant individuals. \n    \n## Mozzarella\n       Mauricio Sanches do Prado/Shutterstock   Mozzarella cheese: creamy, delicious, and a staple for making pizza and other Italian dishes. Mozzarella may be well-loved, but can lactose-intolerant people add it to their list of safe foods to consume? The answer to that question is actually not simple enough to make a broad statement. Mozzarella cheese comes in many forms: logs, slices, blocks, pearls, and shreds, to name a few. Each of these forms of mozzarella has actually been aged for different timeframes, making their lactose contents wildly different.\n According to [SFGate](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/mozzarella-lactose-6826.html), fresh mozzarella, which often comes in log or pearl form, is (as the name implies) fresh, meaning that it still contains quite a bit of lactose. While some of the lactose has already been washed away in the cheese-making process, making it contain less lactose than milk, it's likely not enough to be deemed safe for lactose-intolerant people. However, SFGate reports that hard mozzarella, which is often found in block or shredded form, ferments for about 2 weeks, lowering its lactose content. This fermentation is also what contributes to its firmness. So, for those with lactose intolerance who want to eat mozzarella cheese, be sure to look for mozzarella in firm block or shred form, rather than in fresh logs or pearls. While types of mozzarella can vary in lactose, it generally contains less than one gram of lactose per ounce (per SFGate).\n    \n## Monterey Jack\n       P Kyriakos/Shutterstock   Monterey Jack is a mild and melty cheese often used in quesadillas, burritos, casseroles, and more. Its meltiness even makes it a great addition to a gooey and delicious mac and cheese. But how does it affect your body when you eat it?\n According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1608816/nutrients), a 28-gram serving of Monterey Jack cheese contains 12 percent of your daily recommended protein intake and 20 percent of your daily recommended calcium intake, so it can be a great way to meet your intake goals for those nutrients as part of your balanced diet. While we don't have specifics on the exact amount of lactose in Monterey Jack, USDA reveals that Monterey Jack contains about one gram of carbohydrates in a 28-gram serving. Because lactose is a type of carbohydrate, this means there cannot be more than around 3.5 grams of lactose in a 100-gram serving of Monterey Jack. Most likely, there is far less than that, because lactose is not the only type of carbohydrate found in cheese. This means that you don't have to miss out on a tasty calcium and protein source because of lactose intolerance. \n    \n## Parmesan cheese\n       sweet marshmallow/Shutterstock   Whether you're sprinkling it on pasta and meatballs or a Caesar salad, you can't go wrong with parmesan cheese to add salty, crumbly goodness to your meals. Luckily for those with lactose intolerance, it can also be very low in lactose. According to [Dark Cheese](https://www.darkcheese.com/parmesan-lactose-dairy/), the amount of lactose in parmesan cheese can vary according to the specific process of how each wheel is made. Since parmesan is a hard cheese that has usually aged for quite a bit of time, most parmesan on the market has lost a lot of lactose during the production process. This makes it a pretty reliable bet for those with lactose intolerance. \n However, parmesan can still technically contain anywhere from 0.01 to over 5 percent lactose depending on aging, per Dark Cheese. But, fear not, in the United States specifically, parmesan is legally required to be aged for at least 10 months. Longer aging brings d...",

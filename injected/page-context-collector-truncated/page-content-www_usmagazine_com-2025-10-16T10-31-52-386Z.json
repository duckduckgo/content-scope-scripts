    "content": "[Celebrity News](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/)   \n# How Did Diane Keaton Die? Actress’ Health Reportedly ‘Declined Very Suddenly’\n   By [Justin Harp](https://www.usmagazine.com/author/jharp/)  October 11, 2025  [TOP STORIES](https://www.usmagazine.com/top-stories/?widget=8773&story=268066)         \n\n- \n\n- \n\n       In order to view the video, please allow Manage Cookies\n              [**Diane Keaton**](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/diane-keaton/) reportedly faced upheaval with her health in the final months before her death at age 79.\n Keaton’s spokesperson announced on Saturday, October 11, that [the actress had died](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/diane-keaton-dead-annie-hall-father-of-the-bride-star-was-79/) at age 79 without offering any further details. Her family “asked for privacy” as they grieved their immense loss.\n *Us Weekly* reached out to Keaton’s representatives for comment on her death.\n A friend of Keaton’s subsequently told [*People*](https://people.com/diane-keaton-listed-dream-home-for-sale-declining-health-in-recent-months-exclusive-11828659) the* Annie Hall* star’s health “declined very suddenly” in her last few months as she withdrew from public life. While Keaton was once a fixture of her Brentwood, California, neighborhood — including taking daily walks with her dog Reggie — she suddenly stopped appearing in public earlier this year, according to her friend.\n Keaton reportedly chose to keep the nature of her health issues private from many of her friends, choosing instead to surround herself only with her “her closest family.” She was the mother of two children: daughter Dexter and son Duke, whom she had adopted when they were babies.\n    \n###  [Related: Diane Keaton’s Final Instagram Post Features Dog Reggie for National Pet Day](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/diane-keatons-final-instagram-post-before-death-features-dog-reggie/) \n    In March, [it was reported](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/diane-keaton-los-angeles-mansion-price-cut-by-1-4-million/) that Keaton put her 1920s-style Sullivan Canyon home on the market and even slashed $1.4 Million off the asking process in hopes of selling it quickly. The news was particularly shocking since Keaton practically rebuilt the property from the ground up.\n  Diane Keaton in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage She walked fans through her meticulous multi-year renovation in her 2017 design guide *The House That Pinterest Built*, in which she detailed how using Pinterest boards helped increase the 9,200 square foot residence’s value. (Keaton bought the Sullivan Canyon estate for $4.7 million in 2011, before putting it on the market for $27.5 million earlier this year.)\n Speaking to [*Architectural Digest*](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/diane-keaton-tells-us-about-her-new-book-the-house-that-pinterest-built) in 2017, Keaton mentioned how “soothing” it was to rely on other people’s design innovations from Pinterest while remodeling her home.\n “I’m still in love with it; I’m still in love with Pinterest!” she exclaimed happily. “To me, it’s soothing, because you’re also on a hunt. It leads to something else, and that leads to something else, and it just goes on and on. And that’s the light you want — the light from the computer. It just makes everything look better.”\n  Diane Keaton in February 2004. Vince Bucci/Getty Images Aside from Pinterest, Keaton took surprising inspiration for the remodeling process from the classic children’s fable, *The Three Little Pigs*.\n “[The pigs’ house] was made of bricks,” she wrote in *The House That Pinterest Built*. “I knew I was going to live in a brick house when I grew up.”\n The Academy Award-winning actress was survived by her two children, Dexter and Duke, whom [she adopted in her 50s](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/pictures/celebrity-adoptions-2010911/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1760221217548475&usg=AOvVaw0o5u1ICeUkCwpq4TsNOQiW). She never married, though she had high-profile romances with costars **Woody Allen**, **Al Pacino** and **Warren Beatty** in the 1970s.\n Many of Keaton’s friends, co-stars and famous fans offered poignant tributes following the shocking news of the Hollywood legend’s death.\n    \n###  [Related: Celebs React to the Death of Diane Keaton: Leonardo DiCaprio, More](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/celebrities-react-to-the-death-of-diane-keaton-at-age-79/) \n    “This breaks my heart,” Keaton’s *Father of the Bride* costar **Kimberly Williams-Paisley** wrote. “Getting to work with Diane Keaton will always be one of the highlights of my life. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter.”\n       Deal of the Day [Love an Off-the-Shoulder Look? This Chic Fall Sweater Is 47% Off Right Now](https://amzn.to/4nP6lNj) [View Deal](https://amzn.to/4nP6lNj)      **Josh Gad** described Keaton’s death as a “monumental loss” for Hollywood, adding: “Diane Keaton in many ways defined my love of movies. From *Annie Hall* to the *Godfather* films, from *First Wives Club* to *Baby Boom*, from *Father of the Bride* to *Something’s Gotta Give*, here [sic] resume was nothing short of iconic and hall of fame worthy.”\n The *Frozen* actor referenced other recent deaths of Hollywood titans as he admitted there simply “are no replacements for a **Gene Hackman** or a **Robert Redford** or a Diane Keaton.”\n “They were the mavericks who helped redefine movies for a generation and losing them feels like also losing a chance inactive tissue to that golden age just out of reach,” Gad concluded. “My heart goes out to Diane’s entire family during this impossible moment. RIP.”\n  Just For You        [John Mayer and Influencer Kat Stickler Are Dating After Sparking Rumors in NYC](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/john-mayer-and-kat-stickler-are-dating-but-its-not-serious-source/)   [Nicki Minaj’s $20 Million L.A.

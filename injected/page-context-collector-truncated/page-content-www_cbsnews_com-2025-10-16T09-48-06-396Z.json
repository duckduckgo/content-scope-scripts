    "content": "[Politics](https://www.cbsnews.com/politics?ftag=CNM-16-10abg0d)  \n# Hegseth announces Qatar will build air force facility at U.S. base in Idaho\n    By   Kathryn Watson       Updated on: October 10, 2025 / 7:32 PM EDT / CBS News \n      *Washington *— Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced a finalized agreement that will allow the Qatari Emiri Air Force to build a facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. \nThe agreement, which Hegseth announced alongside Qatari Minister of Defense Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the Pentagon, will allow Qatari pilots to receive training alongside U.S. soldiers. There are no foreign military bases in the U.S., but some foreign militaries do maintain a presence for training. The Singaporean Air Force also has a presence at the Mountain Home base. \nHegseth said he is \"proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.\"\n\"The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership,\" Hegseth said. \"And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.\" \nLater Friday, Hegseth [clarified](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1976769302867898706) that Qatar would not have its own base in the U.S., writing on X: \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft. However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States-nor anything like a base. We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"\n   U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meets with Qatar's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 10, 2025.  Ken Cedeno / REUTERS    The move is another demonstration of the Trump administration's increasingly close relationship with Qatar. \n   President Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/assuring-the-security-of-the-state-of-qatar/) last month \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar,\" following Israel's decision to carry out a [military strike](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-attack-doha-qatar-hamas-leadership/) in Qatar's capital city of Doha, where the vast majority of Qataris live. \"The United States shall regard any armed attack on the territory, sovereignty, or critical infrastructure of the State of Qatar as a threat to the peace and security of the United States,\" the executive order reads. \nQatar also played a \"substantial\" role in the Israel-Hamas peace deal, as Hegseth said Friday and as other top administration officials have acknowledged. \nMr. Trump's [decision](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/qatar-donate-trump-presidential-plane/) to an accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jetliner from Qatar to use as a presidential plane also stirred up debate about ethical and national security-related concerns. When finished, the plane will be used as Air Force One. \n       \n### More from CBS News\n   \n \n- [## Senate fails to advance GOP funding bill for 9th time as shutdown enters Day 16](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-2025-latest-republicans-democrats-trump/?intcid=CNR-02-0623)\n \n- [## FBI agents will get paid despite government shutdown, Patel says](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fbi-pay-government-shutdown-kash-patel/?intcid=CNR-02-0623)\n \n- [## CTA announces fare, pass price hikes for 2026](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/cta-announces-fare-pass-hike-2026/?intcid=CNR-02-0623)\n \n- [## Democratic state Rep.

I’m an addict in recovery, I’ll always be an addict. I have an addictive nature to me.”\nShe recalled how she consumed 2,000 calories a day, before purging afterward. \n“Somebody mentioned that I seemed to have some mental issues, so I went to an analyst,” she shared. “I would go five days a week.”\nThe following year, Keaton told the* Los Angeles Times* about her history with basal cell carcinoma, which she was first diagnosed with at just 21.\n“It’s a family history,” she said in 2015. “I remember my Auntie Martha had skin cancer so bad they removed her nose. My father had basal skin cancer and my brother had it. It’s tricky with this skin cancer. That’s why you’ve got to put the sunblock on.”\nInga Parkel12 October 2025 15:30[Older](?page=1)1 / 5[Newer](?page=2)\n### More about\n[Diane Keaton](/topic/diane-keaton)[Oscar](/topic/oscar)[Woody Allen](/topic/woody-allen)[Film](/topic/film)\n## Join our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n[Comments](#comments-area)",

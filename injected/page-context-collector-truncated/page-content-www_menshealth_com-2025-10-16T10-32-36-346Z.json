Right now, everyone seems to be – and for good reason. One of the most well-researched performance supplements on the market, creatine has been shown to boost [speed](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/workouts/a65860497/sprint-speed-exercises/), [strength](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a65633566/ellis-genge-training-methods/) and [power](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/workouts/a65398157/hyrox-workout-power-leg-strength/) during [high-intensity](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a65677321/hiit-training/) workouts, support recovery, and there’s even emerging evidence to suggest it can have benefits for cognitive and brain health. \nHowever, while it's often flavourless, like with many supps – including [protein powder](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/g43617423/best-protein-powders/) – creatine can have a gritty texture, making it difficult to know what to mix it with. Plus, one side effect of creatine can be [dehydration](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a40638106/dehydration-symptoms/) (it causes water to be drawn into the [muscles](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/train-smarter/a65918592/most-overrated-exercises/)), potentially leading to headaches in some cases. So, is there anything we should avoid mixing it with that might worsen those effects? We asked two nutrition experts for their advice. \n\n## What to Avoid Mixing With Creatine\n\n## **1/ High-Dose Vitamins**\nThe good news? ‘Creatine is remarkably safe and compatible with most supplements. There aren't really any dietary supplements that are off-limits,’ says Dr Samuel Impey, scientific advisor at [Puresport](http://www.puresport.co/). ‘The main caution is with certain medications that heavily impact kidney function.’ \n\n## What to read next\nBearing that in mind, he advises that ‘if you're taking high-dose vitamins, consider spacing them out from your creatine dose to give your kidneys a break from processing everything at once.’\n\n## **2/ Acidic Juices**\nWhile it’s not unsafe, Dr Impey adds that when mixing creatine with acidic juices, such as orange or grapefruit, the acid can degrade the creatine if it has been sitting for a while. So, if you refuse to take [creatine](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a65157906/creatine-super-dose/) without your morning OJ, just be wary of this.\n\n## **3/ Overlapping Ingredients**\nIf you’re taking multiple supplements, such as protein powders, pre-workout, and creatine, it’s wise to double-check the ingredient lists on each. ‘Many supplements contain \"bonus\" ingredients like trace [vitamins](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a65477056/vitamin-d-deficiency-strength-gains/), [amino acids](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a64905464/amino-acid-supplements/), or other additives that companies include as value-adds,’ says Dr Impey. ‘When you're taking multiple products, you can easily end up over-consuming these extras without realising it.’\nAlthough this isn’t dangerous per se, it can put ‘unnecessary strain on your kidneys to process and eliminate what your body doesn't need,’ he explains. ‘The key is choosing reputable brands with clean formulations that stick to essential ingredients only.’\nIndeed, some [protein powders](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/g43363892/best-vegan-protein-powders/) and pre-workouts already contain creatine as an add-on, so while it would be very difficult to overdose on creatine, it’s always important to check what and how much of something you’re actually consuming. ‘Stick to 5-10g [of creatine] daily, depending on your needs,’ advises Dr Impey. \nRelated Story\n\n- [Are Pre-Workouts Safe?](/uk/nutrition/a65381705/are-pre-workouts-safe/)\n\n\n## **4/ Alcohol **\nThis might sound like an obvious one, and while there are ‘no known direct interactions between the two, both can contribute to dehydration, so it's really important to keep hydrated – more than usual – if you do plan to have both in the same day,’ says registered dietitian [Clementine Vaughan](https://thirdsister.co.uk/about-dietitian-nutritionist-in-london/). ‘For example, creatine in the morning and a boozy dinner/lunch later in the day. Just be really mindful of drinking plenty of water.’ \nIn that vein, Vaughan adds, it’s important to consider any substances that might exacerbate dehydration – like diuretics and stimulants. ‘Make sure that if you're throwing back tonnes of coffee, you match it with a good amount of water.’\nRelated Story\n\n- [How Does Coffee Affect Your Sleeping Brain?](/uk/nutrition/food-drink/a64943402/coffee-sleep-brain-health/)\n\n\n## **5/ NSAIDs **\nCommon examples of NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, include ibuprofen and aspirin, and there are some references online suggesting that combining them with creatine isn’t advisable. Is there any merit to those claims?\n‘There are no studies that definitively show that if you combine the two for a long time, you'll develop kidney damage – because that would be pretty unethical – but the advice is that if you have some form of kidney damage you should avoid NSAIDs and creatine supplements as this can worsen your condition further,’ says Vaughan. \n‘For a healthy individual with no kidney problems, it's likely that the one-off use of NSAIDs while taking creatine supplements will be okay. However, it is definitely preferable to opt for different types of medication if possible as you're giving your kidneys more to deal with from both the NSAIDs and the creatine.’ \nIf you have any concerns, though, Vaughan urges you to consult your GP, ‘who can advise you on what is best to take, especially if it's for something more than a one-off.’\n\n## What You *Should* Mix With Creatine\n‘Take it with a [carbohydrate](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/food-drink/a65933275/complex-carbs-list/) source to enhance uptake through insulin response,’ says Dr Impey. ‘Post-workout is ideal because your body acts like a sponge, ready to absorb nutrients – a [protein](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a65663518/signs-not-enough-protein-and-deficiency/) and carbohydrate shake after exercise is perfect timing to maximise absorption and support recovery.’\n[Smoothies](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/recipes/g64486256/breakfast-smoothies/) are a great option, he adds, ‘because you can combine [fruit](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/food-drink/a65567815/healthiest-fruits/) (natural carbs), protein powder or [milk](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/food-drink/a64654941/healthiest-milk-types/), and fibre all in one.’ A quick ‘shot’ approach works too – ‘mix 5g into a small, flavourful liquid like a ginger shot and down it quickly.’\nIf you don’t mind the texture, Vaughan says mixing it into a good old glass of water is a great way to take creatine. Otherwise, adding it to yoghurt, porridge or [overnight oats](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a757695/how-to-make-the-perfect-overnight-oats/) is a good way to sneak it in. \nRelated Stories\n\n- [Can You Overdose on Creatine?](/uk/nutrition/a65859043/can-you-take-too-much-creatine/)\n\n- [What Happens When You Stop Taking Creatine?](/uk/nutrition/a65560492/what-happens-when-you-stop-taking-creatine/)\n\n- [Can Creatine Make You Smarter?](/uk/nutrition/a63369007/creatine-brain-health/)\n\n[Hannah Bradfield](/uk/author/438084/hannah-bradfield/)Senior Health and Fitness WriterHannah Bradfield is a Senior Health and Fitness Writer for *Women’s Health UK*.

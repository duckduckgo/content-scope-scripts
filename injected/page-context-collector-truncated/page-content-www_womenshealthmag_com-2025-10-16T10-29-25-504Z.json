[Why Trust Us?](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/about/a24170223/about-womens-health/)\n[Protein powder](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g62739382/best-tasting-protein-powders/) is a popular option for anyone looking to [hit their macros](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19713960/how-to-count-macros-for-weight-loss/) or [crush their gym goals](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a41958183/how-much-proten-do-you-need/). But a new report suggests that many of these products could contain dangerous levels of [heavy metals](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63239501/prenatal-vitamins-heavy-metals-study/).\nThat's the takeaway from a new [report](https://cleanlabelproject.org/wp-content/uploads/CleanLabelProject_ProteinStudyWhitepaper_010625.pdf) by the Clean Label Project, which was released on January 9.\n\"The study’s findings highlight that despite the growing health-conscious market, many products may contain elevated levels of contaminants not reflected on traditional nutrition labels,\" the report says.\nSo, which heavy metals were found—and which protein powders are safe? Here's what a food safety expert wants you to know.\n**Meet the expert**: [Felicia Wu, PhD,](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/wu) is a professor of food safety, toxicology, and risk assessment at Michigan State University.\n\n## **Which heavy metals were found in protein powders?** \nLead and cadmium were found in a majority of the protein powders that were tested. There is no safe level of lead, which has been [linked](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lead-poisoning-and-health) to developmental disorders and high blood pressure. \nAnd chronic cadmium exposure can damage the kidneys, bones, and lungs, as well as raise your risk for certain types of cancer, according to the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://www.osha.gov/cadmium) (OSHA).\n\"Lead is a known neurotoxin, and cadmium has been shown to cause harmful effects to bones and kidneys,\" says [Felicia Wu, PhD,](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/wu) a professor of food safety, toxicology, and risk assessment at Michigan State University.\nRelated Stories\n\n- [These Heavy Metals Found In Prenatal Vitamins](/health/a63239501/prenatal-vitamins-heavy-metals-study/)\n\n- [Best Protein Powders For Hitting Your Macro Goals](/fitness/g44630683/best-protein-powders-for-women/)\n\n- [These Herbal Supplements Linked To Liver Damage](/health/a61973555/supplements-liver-damage/)\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe January 9 report only shared results for lead, cadmium, BPA, and BPS testing. Data on other contaminants will be released in a later update, Clean Label Project executive director Jaclyn Bowen told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/health/protein-powder-heavy-metals-wellness/index.html). \nThe good news? BPA and BPS were only found in three of the 160 protein powders that were tested.\n\n## **Which protein powders had heavy metals in them?**\nUnfortunately, the report did not include the brands or product names. “We do not disclose the names of companies we test in order to maintain fairness and consistency and to avoid potential conflicts of interest,” Bowen told CNN.\nAccording to the report, 77 percent of plant-based protein powders, 79 percent of organic protein powders, and 65 percent of chocolate-flavored protein powders tested over the California Proposition 65 safety thresholds for toxic metals.\nPlant-based protein powders—made from rice, peas or soy—were found to contain triple the amount of lead compared to whey protein powders, which are made from the liquid byproduct of cheese, per the report. Meanwhile, chocolate-flavored protein powders contained four times more lead and up to 110 times more cadmium than vanilla-flavored powders.\nResearchers tested 160 products from 70 top protein powder brands, which represented 83 percent of the market, the report says. For the study, an independent certified laboratory ran nearly 36,000 tests on 258 different contaminants. \n\n## **Which protein powders are safe from heavy metals?**\nThe Clean Label Project has also released a list of \"the best\" protein powders \"based on our rigorous product testing.\" It includes brands like WICKED Protein, Ritual, and Needed., and can be found [here](https://cleanlabelproject.org/the-best-worst-protein-powder-products/).\nProtein Powders Certified By The Clean Label ProjectPuori Puori Whey Protein Powder - Bourbon Vanilla[$77 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0736B62K5?tag=womenshealth-auto-20)[$101 at Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/3006986/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F111678915%3Fselected%3Dtrue&subId1=wmh&subId3=xid:{xid})WICKED Protein WICKED Protein Powder, Clear Whey Isolate (Tropical Punch)[$39 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BC5TX6SH?tag=womenshealth-auto-20)Needed.

The California Proposition 65 safety recommendations are for amounts per day, but it's unclear how much protein powder the Clean Label Project assumed people were consuming each day, she points out.\n\"Without this more detailed information, we cannot say what the real risk to human health is,\" Wu says.\nRelated Stories\n\n- [What Does Organic Really Mean?](/food/a19911279/what-does-organic-really-mean/)\n\n- [How Climate Change Is Impacting Your Skin](/beauty/a63072710/climate-change-skin/)\n\n- [Should You Be Using a Sulfate-Free Shampoo?](/beauty/a19983107/sulfate-free-shampoo/)\n\nHowever if you're concerned, the data suggests that whey- or egg-based and vanilla-flavored protein powders contain have the least amount of heavy metals. If you follow a plant-based diet, vanilla-flavored protein powders made from peas appear to have the least amount of heavy metals. \n[Charlotte Walsh](/author/286528/charlotte-walsh/)Associate News EditorCharlotte Walsh is the associate news editor at Women’s Health, where she pitches, assigns, edits, and writes daily pieces on celebrity health and scientific studies.

They are one of many ways to invest in gold. Gold ETFs are an easy way to gain instant exposure to the gold market, making them ideal for anyone seeking to invest in gold.\n     Image source: Getty Images.    Gold ETFs fall into two basic categories:\n\n\n- Those that own physical gold.\n\n- Those that own [gold mining stocks](/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/gold-stocks/).\n\nHere's a closer look at the top gold ETF options.\n     \n## What to look for in the best gold ETFs\nInvestors considering an [ETF](/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/) focused on gold should look for the following characteristics:\n\n\n- **Large size:** The ETF should have at least $200 million of [assets under management](/terms/a/aum/) (AUM). A larger size makes the ETF less likely to fall prey to market manipulation or trade at a significant premium to its net asset value.\n\n- **Reasonable expense ratio:** Look for an [expense ratio](/terms/e/etf-expense-ratio/) of less than 1%. Any expense ratio of more than 1.5% is considered excessive.\n\n- **Non-leveraged ETFs:** A [leveraged ETF](/terms/l/leveraged-etfs/) borrows money or uses derivatives, such as [options](/terms/o/options/) and [futures contracts](/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/futures-trading/), to magnify its returns. These carry much higher risk, and leverage in a down market can magnify losses.\n\n        \n###  [Assets Under Management (AUM)](/terms/a/aum/) \n The total market value of the financial assets an entity or advisor manages for their clients.     With those criteria in mind, here are some of the best gold ETFs.\n\n## Top gold ETFs\nThe best gold ETFs are:\n      Data as of Oct 16, 2025.     Company name   Company ticker      [SPDR Gold Trust](/quote/nysemkt/gld/) [NYSEMKT:GLD](/quote/nysemkt/gld/)   [iShares Gold Trust](/quote/nysemkt/iau/) [NYSEMKT:IAU](/quote/nysemkt/iau/)   [Abrdn Gold ETF Trust - Abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF](/quote/nysemkt/sgol/) [NYSEMKT:SGOL](/quote/nysemkt/sgol/)   [Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF](/quote/nysemkt/aaau/) [NYSEMKT:AAAU](/quote/nysemkt/aaau/)   [VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Gold Miners ETF](/quote/nysemkt/gdx/) [NYSEMKT:GDX](/quote/nysemkt/gdx/)   [VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF](/quote/nysemkt/gdxj/) [NYSEMKT:GDXJ](/quote/nysemkt/gdxj/)   [Franklin Templeton Trust - Responsibly Sourced Gold ETF](/quote/nysemkt/fgdl/) [NYSEMKT:FGDL](/quote/nysemkt/fgdl/)       Here's a closer look at each of these top gold ETFs.\n\n### 1. SPDR Gold Trust\n\n    Collapse  \n## [NYSEMKT: GLD](/quote/nysemkt/gld/)\n SPDR Gold Trust Today's Change (1.75%) $6.67 Current Price $387.46  YTD1w1m3m 6m  1y5y  Price   VS S&P    GLD   \n### Key Data Points\n  Day's Range $384.60 - $387.74 52wk Range $236.13 - $387.75 Volume 127,930      \nSPDR Gold Trust is the largest and most [liquid](/terms/l/liquidity/) gold ETF. It's the gold standard for investors seeking direct exposure to the price of the yellow metal. The ETF's sole asset is gold bullion, which it stores in secure vaults.\n     Investors pay a premium for this leading gold ETF. It has a higher expense ratio than other ETFs that own physical gold bullion at 0.4%.\nHowever, it's still relatively cheaper than shipping, insuring, and storing gold bars and coins, especially when you factor in its liquidity. Its large size makes it a favorite of [institutional investors](/terms/i/institutional-investor/), such as pension funds that use it to [hedge](/terms/h/hedging/) against [inflation](/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/) and other risk factors.\n\n### 2. iShares Gold Trust\n\n    Expand  \n## [NYSEMKT: IAU](/quote/nysemkt/iau/)\n iShares Gold Trust Today's Change (1.65%) $1.29 Current Price $79.32  YTD1w1m3m 6m  1y5y  Price   VS S&P    IAU   \n### Key Data Points\n  Day's Range $78.76 - $79.39 52wk Range $48.29 - $79.39 Volume 186,342      \niShares Gold Trust is almost identical to SPDR Gold Shares, making it another great means of investing directly in gold. It boasts a lower expense ratio than its larger rival (0.25%), making it an even lower-cost way to gain upside exposure to the price of gold.\n     Owning shares in this ETF is a great proxy for owning physical gold without the hassle and expense of storing or insuring bars and coins. The ETF handles these items, storing its bullion in the London branch of [**JPMorgan Chase**](/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/who-owns-jpmorgan-chase/) ([JPM](/quote/nyse/jpm/)  1.2%). Overall, this gold ETF has done an excellent job of tracking the price of gold, with only a minor underperformance due to its expense ratio.\n      \n### 3. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF\n\n    Expand  \n## [NYSEMKT: GDX](/quote/nysemkt/gdx/)\n VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Gold Miners ETF Today's Change (3.85%) $3.02 Current Price $81.47  YTD1w1m3m 6m  1y5y  Price   VS S&P    GDX   \n### Key Data Points\n  Day's Range $79.24 - $81.74 52wk Range $33.42 - $81.74 Volume 82,924      \nVanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is the largest ETF focused on holding shares of major gold mining stocks. That makes it the best gold ETF for those who want to invest in mining companies as a way to play the gold market.\n     Shares of mining companies can outperform the price of gold. They can benefit from the dual catalysts of production growth and a rising gold price. However, owning mining stocks is riskier than investing directly in gold because cost inflation and other factors can cause underperformance.\nAs of mid-2025, the ETF held shares of almost 70 gold-mining companies. Its top holdings included the largest gold mining companies in the world by [market capitalization](/terms/m/market-cap/), led by the following five:\n\n\n- **Newmont** ([NEM](/quote/nyse/nem/) 3.36%)\n\n- **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](/quote/nyse/aem/) 4.41%)\n\n- **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](/quote/nyse/wpm/) 1.64%)\n\n- **Barrick Gold** ([B](/quote/nyse/b/) 4.1%)\n\n- **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](/quote/nyse/fnv/) 0.17%)\n\nThe market cap of the largest mining company on this list tops $65 billion, while the smallest is more than $30 billion. The gold ETF's top 10 holdings comprise almost 65% of its assets, led by Newmont at 12.7%, giving investors greater exposure to the world's largest gold mining companies and making the ETF ideal for investors seeking quality over quantity. The fund offers this exposure to the top gold mining stocks at a reasonable cost (0.51% expense ratio).\n\n### 4. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF\n\n    Expand  \n## [NYSEMKT: GDXJ](/quote/nysemkt/gdxj/)\n VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF Today's Change (4.69%) $4.86 Current Price $108.48  YTD1w1m3m 6m  1y5y  Price   VS S&P    GDXJ   \n### Key Data Points\n  Day's Range $105.47 - $109.20 52wk Range $41.85 - $109.20 Volume 63,525      \nVanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF offers the most upside potential because it focuses on smaller [mining companies](/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/mining-stocks/), known as junior gold miners, some of which are stil...",

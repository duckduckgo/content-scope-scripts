    "content": "# The 10 Greatest Diane Keaton Movies, Ranked\n      Image via United Artists               By  [Jeremy Urquhart](/author/jeremy-urquhart/)    Published 4 days ago   Jeremy has more than 2000 published articles on Collider to his name, and has been writing for the site since February 2022. He's an omnivore when it comes to his movie-watching diet, so will gladly watch and write about almost anything, from old Godzilla films to gangster flicks to samurai movies to classic musicals to the French New Wave to the MCU... well, maybe not the Disney+ shows.\n His favorite directors include Martin Scorsese, Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa, Quentin Tarantino, Werner Herzog, John Woo, Bob Fosse, Fritz Lang, Guillermo del Toro, and Yoji Yamada. He's also very proud of the fact that he's seen every single Nicolas Cage movie released before 2022, even though doing so often felt like a tremendous waste of time. He's plagued by the question of whether or not The Room is genuinely terrible or some kind of accidental masterpiece, and has been for more than 12 years (and a similar number of viewings).\n When he's not writing lists - and the occasional feature article - for Collider, he also likes to upload film reviews to his Letterboxd profile (username: Jeremy Urquhart) and Instagram account.\n He is also currently in the process of trying to become a Stephen King expert by reading all 2397 novels written by the author.                                           Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:                      **Diane Keaton** was active, as an actress, for more than half a century, and proved remarkably versatile in that time. The earliest stage of her career was defined by her roles in various New Hollywood movies and a fair few comedies (some of them, yes, directed by **Woody Allen**), while in the 1990s and beyond, she was in various prominent rom-coms, even earning an Oscar nomination for one of them: 2003’s ***Something's Gotta Give***.\n She [passed away at the age of 79](https://collider.com/diane-keaton-dead-at-79-obituary/) in October 2025, and will likely remain singular and inimitable for as long as the world keeps turning. She had a unique screen presence, and was also well known for her distinctive style and fashion sense. The **following is a rundown of some of her best films, not including voice roles or any of her directing work** (she dabbled in the latter, even directing an episode for the second season of [***Twin Peaks***](https://collider.com/tag/twin-peaks/)).\n \n##  10   'The Godfather Part III' (1990)  \n       Image via Paramount Pictures   To get the obvious out of the way, no, [***The Godfather Part III***](https://collider.com/tag/the-godfather-part-iii/) is not as good as the other two movies, both of them among [the finest gangster films of all time](https://collider.com/best-gangster-movies-last-100-years-ranked/) (to state the obvious… and yes, they’ll be talked about a bit more in a bit). But *The Godfather Part III* is still a good gangster movie, so long as you can navigate your way around the stuff that doesn’t work the same way you might eat around a mostly tasty dish that’s been overcooked or mildly burned in a few places.\n It's a movie about Michael Corleone getting old and having certain regrets about the things he did in the past, seeking a redemption that may be too difficult to attain at such a stage in his life. **Al Pacino** and **Diane Keaton both deliver good performances, returning as Michael and Kay, respectively**, while [**Francis Ford Coppola** directs the whole thing](https://collider.com/francis-ford-coppola-movies-ranked/) pretty well, too (it’s better than some of his other movies released in either the 1980s or 1990s, that’s for sure).\n \n##  9   'Father of the Bride' (1991)  \n       Image via Buena Vista Pictures Distribution   [***Father of the Bride***](https://collider.com/tag/movie/father-of-the-bride-1991/) might've set something of a precedent for much of Diane Keaton’s later career, since she was in a good many rom-coms from this point onward, though not exclusively, as an Oscar-nominated turn in ***Marvin's Room*** shows. But *Father of the Bride* is [very much a romantic comedy](https://collider.com/best-rom-coms-last-50-years-ranked/), and also one about family, since much of the film revolves around the sometimes-difficult planning of a wedding.\n It's bubbly and a little silly, but *Father of the Bride* also has a good heart, and stands as an overall worthy remake of *Father of the Bride* (1950). For [as long as weddings cause stress](https://screenrant.com/best-movie-wedding-scenes-list/) and more than a little chaos, both versions of *Father of the Bride* will surely remain… **relevant? Maybe that’s not the right word. “Cathartic” is probably the better word, or “endearing.”** Yeah, they’ll remain those things.\n \n##  8   'Manhattan Murder Mystery' (1993)  \n       Image via Tristar Pictures   While it’s a mystery film and a comedy, ***Manhattan Murder Mystery*** is [primarily focused on delivering laughs](https://collider.com/best-comedy-movies-last-50-years-ranked/), and it does a pretty great job at just that. It’s also the better Woody Allen movie to star Diane Keaton and him that also has the word “*Manhattan*” in the title, since, well, ***Manhattan*** (1979) doesn’t hold up the best. But if you don’t count ***Radio Days***, which just featured a cameo by Keaton, then *Manhattan* was the last film she did with Allen until *Manhattan Murder Mystery*, for whatever that’s worth.\n This one’s fairly farcical, seeing the two aforementioned actors playing a couple who have suspicions about their neighbor possibly being responsible for the sudden death of his wife. They investigate the whole thing quite poorly, and it makes for a movie that rambles along but in a funny and sometimes charming way.\n \n##  7   'Reds' (1981)  \n       Image via Paramount Pictures   The first thing that stands out about [***Reds***](https://collider.com/tag/reds-film/) is how big it is, with its runtime being well over three hours, and its scope being similarly grand, since it tells the story of an American journalist being inspired by the Russian Revolution to spread socialist ideals back in the U.S. So, it’s got quite a few locations, and the narrative, while not quite spanning decades, does cover a handful of years.\n The second thing that stands out about *Reds* is its cast, which might well be one of the most stacked of the 1980s. Beyond Diane Keaton, you’ve also got performances by the likes of [**Warren Beatty** (who also directed)](https://collider.com/warren-beatty-movies-best-ranked/), **Jack Nicholson**, **Paul Sorvino**, and (briefly) **Gene Hackman**. It **feels like a bit of a last hurrah for New Hollywood and the sorts of ideals that defined many American movies** from the late 1960s until the early 1980s, and the whole thing still [holds up as a rather impressive epic film](https://collider.com/greatest-epic-movies-ranked/).\n \n##  6   'Play It Again, Sam' (1972)  \n       Image via Paramount Pictures   Written by Woody Allen, but directed by **Herbert Ross**, ***Play It Again, Sam*** is another comedy with Allen and Keaton in the lead roles that honestly holds up surprisingly well. It probably helps that it’s a movie that partly revolves around one of the most timeless in cinema history, [***Casablanca***](https://collider.com/tag/movie/casablanca/), with Allen’s character being someone who’s obsessed with the film and has Humphrey Bogart as, essentially, an imaginary friend.\n Like *Casablanca*, it’s [also something of a romance film](https://collider.com/best-romantic-movies-last-100-years-ranked/), given it’s about Allen’s character trying to find someone to date after going through a divorce, but if it’s a rom-com, it’s one that puts the emphasis on the “com.” ***Play It Again, Sam* works a lot better than that description might lead you to believe**, and really, the biggest sin it commits is having a misquote as a title, seeing as in *Casablanca*, Ilsa says, “Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'”\n \n##  5   'Love and Death' (1975)  \n       Image via United Artists   You can compare ***Love and Death*** to the previously mentioned Allen + Keaton films, but also, it’s got the Russian setting that the aforementioned Reds had, albeit set about a century earlier (the 1810s instead of the 1910s). It’s also a bit of a weird one, by Woody Allen’s standards, given the historical setting, but that does also help it stand out.\n Also helping *Love and Death* is the fact that it’s very funny, being one of [the rare movies about **Napoleon**](https://collider.com/napoleonic-war-movies-best-ranked/) that's not necessarily definable as a drama or war film. **The sense of humor here is dark at times, with more death than love**, but that’s [in line with ***War and Peace***](https://collider.com/most-ambitious-epic-movies-of-all-time-ranked/) (set around the same time) having a bit more by way of war than peace, so it fits.\n \n##  4   'Looking for Mr. Goodbar' (1977)  \n      While ***Looking for Mr. Goodbar*** is an exceptionally difficult film to watch, it is an absolutely essential one, and probably stands as the most underrated movie Diane Keaton ever starred in. Also, unlike some of the other movies being mentioned here, she’s undeniably the star of this one, playing a woman who goes to various single bars looking for what would nowadays be described as “casual” encounters or ...",

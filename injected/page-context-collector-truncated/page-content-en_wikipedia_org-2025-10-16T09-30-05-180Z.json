His crimes, committed around his hometown of [Plainfield, Wisconsin](/wiki/Plainfield,_Wisconsin), gathered widespread notoriety in 1957 after authorities discovered that he exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned keepsakes from their bones and skin. He also confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957. It is believed Gein's actions were caused by severe [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis). \nGein was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility. By 1968 he was judged competent to stand trial. He was found guilty of the murder of Worden, but was found legally insane and thus was [remanded](/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)) to a psychiatric institution. \n  \n## Early life\n \n### Childhood\n Edward Theodore Gein was born in [La Crosse County, Wisconsin](/wiki/La_Crosse_County,_Wisconsin), on August 27, 1906,[[1]](#cite_note-birthrecord-1) the second of two sons to George Philip Gein (1873–1940)[[2]](#cite_note-Schechter2010-2) and Augusta Wilhelmine Gein ([née](/wiki/Birth_name) Lehrke; 1878–1945).[[3]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198959-3) Gein's only sibling was an older brother named Henry.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198954-4) Augusta, who was fervently religious and nominally [Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheran),[[5]](#cite_note-autogenerated2007-5) frequently preached to her sons about the innate immorality of the world, the evils of drinking and her belief that all women were naturally promiscuous and instruments of the devil. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting verses from the Old Testament and the [Book of Revelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) concerning death, murder, and [divine retribution](/wiki/Divine_retribution).[[5]](#cite_note-autogenerated2007-5) Gein idolized and eventually became obsessed with his mother.[[6]](#cite_note-6)[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) \nIn La Crosse, Gein's father worked as a carpenter, tanner, and firefighter. He also owned a local grocery store but soon sold the business and left the city with his family to live on a 155-acre (63-hectare) farm in the town of [Plainfield, Wisconsin](/wiki/Plainfield_(town),_Wisconsin),[[9]](#cite_note-:1-9) which became their permanent residence.[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10) Gein's father was known to be a violent alcoholic who regularly beat both of his sons. This caused Ed's ears to ring when his father beat him on the head.[[11]](#cite_note-11) Augusta took advantage of the farm's isolation by turning away outsiders who could have influenced her sons.[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10) \n The [1930 US census](/wiki/1930_United_States_census) with Gein, 13th name from the top, in Plainfield, Wisconsin Gein left the farm only to attend school. Outside of school, he spent most of his time doing chores on the farm. Gein was shy. Classmates and teachers remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if he were laughing at his own personal jokes. Augusta punished Gein whenever he tried to make friends, according to family acquaintances. Despite his poor social development, Gein did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10) \n \n### Deaths in immediate family\n On April 1, 1940, the Gein brothers' father died of heart failure at the age of 66. Ed and his brother Henry began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. The brothers were generally considered reliable and honest by the rest of the community. While both worked as handymen, Ed frequently babysat for neighbors, seeming to relate more easily to children than to adults. Henry began dating a divorced mother of two and planned to move in with her. He worried about his brother's attachment to their mother and often spoke ill of her around Ed, who responded with shock and hurt.[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10) \nOn May 16, 1944, Ed was burning away marsh vegetation on the property.[[12]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGollmar198185-12) The fire got out of control, drawing the attention of the local fire department. By the end of the day—the fire having been extinguished and the firefighters gone—Ed reported Henry missing. With lanterns and flashlights, a search party searched for 43-year-old Henry, whose dead body was found lying face down.[[13]](#cite_note-Wisconsin_Rapids_Page_1-13) Apparently, Henry had been dead for some time, and it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure, since he had not been burned or injured otherwise.[[13]](#cite_note-Wisconsin_Rapids_Page_1-13) \nIt was later reported by biographer [Harold Schechter](/wiki/Harold_Schechter) that Henry had bruises on his head.[[14]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198930-14)[[15]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198931-15) Police dismissed the possibility of foul play and the county coroner later listed [asphyxiation](/wiki/Asphyxia) as the cause of death.[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10)[[14]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198930-14)[[15]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198931-15) The authorities accepted the accident theory, but no official investigation was conducted and an autopsy was not performed.[[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGollmar198186-16) Questioning Ed about the death of Bernice Worden in 1957, state investigator Joe Wilimovsky brought up questions about Henry's death.[[12]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGollmar198185-12) George Arndt, who studied the case, wrote that, in retrospect, it was \"possible and likely\" that Henry's death was \"the '[Cain and Abel](/wiki/Cain_and_Abel)' aspect of this case.\"[[17]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGollmar19818-17)[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGollmar19819-18) \nWith Henry deceased, Ed and his mother were now alone. Augusta suffered a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Ed devoted himself to her care. Sometime in 1945, he later recounted, he and his mother visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to purchase straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith residence came outside and yelled for him to stop, but Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene; what bothered her did not appear to be the brutality toward the dog but, rather, the presence of the woman.[[19]](#cite_note-19) \nAugusta told Gein that the woman was not married to Smith and so had no business being there, angrily calling her \"Smith's harlot.\" She suffered a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly.[[20]](#cite_note-20) Augusta died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Gein was devastated by his mother's death. In the words of Schechter, he had \"lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world\".[[14]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198930-14)[[15]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchechter198931-15) \n \n## Work\n Gein held onto the farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched. While the rest of the house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading [pulp magazines](/wiki/Pulp_magazine) and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities,[[10]](#cite_note-biography-10) specifically concerning [Ilse Koch](/wiki/Ilse_Koch), who had been accused of selecting tattooed prisoners for death to fashion [lampshades](/wiki/Lampshades_made_from_human_skin) and other items from their skins.[[21]](#cite_note-21) In 1951, Gein started receiving a farm subsidy from the federal government. He occasionally worked for the local municipal road crew and crop-threshing crews in the Plainfield area. Sometime between 1...",

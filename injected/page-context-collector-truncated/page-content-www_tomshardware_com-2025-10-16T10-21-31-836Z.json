If you're doing a clean install with a Windows 11 ISO, you can edit the registry in the middle of the setup process and tell it to skip requirement checks. We'll show you how to modify the registry in the first section below.\nIf you don't want to have to modify the registry mid-install, you can create a Windows 11 USB install disk that will bypass Windows 11's TPM requirement, and its need for 8GB of RAM and a supported CPU. Using a free tool called Rufus and at least a 16GB Flash drive, you can either perform an in-place upgrade of Windows 10 to 11 or a Windows 11 clean install while getting around these minimums. In the second section of our tutorial below, we'll show you how to use Rufus to create a requirement-free Windows 11 install disc.\nLatest Videos From Tom's Hardware  You may like  \n \n- [Ditching Windows 10?

As we'll detail in the third section below, a script from AveYo's Media Creation tool github page will allow you to bypass Windows 11's TPM requirement even with Windows Update.\nNote that Microsoft also has also created an official registry hack to bypass TPM 2.0 and CPU requirements for an in-place upgrade. However, this method still requires at least TPM 1.2 so, if you have no TPM at all, it's worthless. We'll talk about this at the bottom, in case you want to try it.\nAlso note that, by default, Microsoft's OS wants you to set it up with a Microsoft account. However, we have another tutorial on [how to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft Account](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-without-microsoft-account) by using a few tricks.\n    \n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n## How to Bypass Windows 11's TPM Requirement Using Registry Hacks\nIf you just have a regular Windows 11 install disk or ISO, you can bypass the Windows TPM and RAM requirements by making some registry changes during the install. Note that this method only works on a clean install and does not allow you to bypass the requirement for at least a dual-core CPU.\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the [Terms & Conditions](https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/) and [Privacy Policy](https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/) and are aged 16 or over.1. **Boot off of your Windows 11 install disk**.

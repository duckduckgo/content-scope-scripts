    "content": "The average penis is between 5.1 and 5.5 inches, with most people falling within this range. Penis enlargement methods do exist, but many may be harmful, do not work, or have temporary effects.\nThe average penis size is not nearly as big as many people think it is!\nA [2020 review of research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2020.1787279) on penis size found that the average length of an [erect penis](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/what-is-an-erection) is between 5.1 inches and 5.5 inches. Factoring in volunteer bias, the researchers believe that the average falls closer to the lower end of that range.\nOlder 2014 research pegged the average length of a [flaccid penis](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/flaccid-penis) at [3.61 inchesTrusted Source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13010/abstract).\nKeep reading for answers to all your questions about penis size, like whether [size matters](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/does-size-matter) to a partner and what you can do about it.\n\n## Average penis length and other statistics\nLet’s start with some interesting numbers:\n\n\n- When it comes to length, the [averageTrusted Source](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010) is 3.61 for a flaccid penis and 5.16 inches for an erect penis.\n\n- [Most peopleTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558040/) with penises overestimate what the average penis size actually is, according to 2015 research.\n\n- Many people with penises are under the impression that the average package is over 6 inches long — a notion that [researchersTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32666897/) partially attribute to older studies that were based on self-reported measurements.\n\n- Based on [various reports](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318023027_A_Structured_Review_and_Critical_Analysis_of_Male_Perceptions_of_the_Penis_A_Comparison_between_Heterosexual_Men_and_Men_Who_Have_Sex_with_Men_MSM), [many peopleTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32666897/) with penises wish they had a larger penis, including those who have average-sized ones.\n\n- For some perspective, an erect penis of 6.3 inches falls into the [95 percentileTrusted Source](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010), according to 2014 research, meaning that only 5 out of 100 people would have a penis longer than 6.3 inches.\n\n- Likewise, an erect penis of 3.94 inches is in the [5 percentileTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9809495/), meaning that only 5 out of 100 would have a penis shorter than 3.94 inches.\n\n- [Around 95 percentTrusted Source](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bju.13010) of penises do fall into the average range.\n\n- Average erect penis length [may have increased](https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.220203) worldwide in the past few decades. The researchers theorize it may have to do with people with penises reaching puberty earlier, increased body size, and exposure to hormone-disrupting substances.\n\nSo to recap, research says the average penis size is a lot smaller than what most people believe it is and usually looks nothing like what you see in porn.\n\n### How to measure your penis size\nIf you want to measure your penis, the length is measured from the top to the tip.\n\nThe top of your penis is where it meets your pubic bone, and the tip is the very end of the glans, aka the head.\n\nTo get the most accurate measurement, compress any fat in front of your pubic bone. Also, don’t include any extra length from your foreskin. If you want to measure girth, measure around the base or middle of your shaft.\n\n## Does penis size matter for sex?\nWhen it comes to sex, [penis size](https://www.healthline.com/health/is-penis-size-genetic) really doesn’t matter. It doesn’t affect desirability, function, or [health](https://www.healthline.com/health/penis-health).\nA penis doesn’t need to be big to have sex, pee, or reproduce. Size only matters as much as you let it.\nPeople with penises and people with vaginas [report dissatisfactionTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558040/) with the appearance of their own genitals. \nWorrying about having a smaller-than-average penis can drain your confidence and affect your ability to enjoy sex. Furthermore, [stress and anxiety](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-anxiety-stress) can make it more difficult to get an erection or climax.\nPsychological factors, like stress, are common causes of [erectile dysfunction](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction).\n\n## Can you increase the size of your penis?\nYou can, but most of the methods available only offer a temporary, marginal increase in size. Beware of miracle [methods](https://www.healthline.com/health/do-penis-enlargement-techniques-work) advertised online, like pills and [oils](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/oil-for-penis-enlargement), that can do more harm than good to your penis and your pocketbook.\nThe following are some of the more popular penis enlargement methods available:\n\n\n- **Penis pumps:** [Penis pumps](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/best-penis-pump) are devices that use suction to draw blood into the penis, engorging the blood vessels in your penis so it gets — temporarily — harder and bigger. Putting on a [cock ring](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/best-cock-ring) can help the blood remain in your penis longer. Both are typically considered safe when used correctly.\n\n- **Traction devices:** Penile traction devices are most useful for correcting curvatures and deformities of the penis, but they may provide a small, temporary increase in size. A [2022 reviewTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120847/) found that penile traction therapy may have benefits for people with smaller penises, though additional research is still needed. This therapy is typically recommended for people with [Peyronie’s disease](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/peyronies-disease) and ED.\n\n- **Stretching exercises:** [Stretching exercises](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/penis-stretching), like [jelqing](https://www.healthline.com/health/jelqing), use massage to manipulate the tissues and skin of the penis. This creates micro tears, that when healed, look engorged and make the penis bigger and thicker. Most of the “evidence” on these techniques is anecdotal. There’s no science-backed evidence to support their use.\n\n[Surgical implantation](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/penis-enlargement-surgery-cost) of a synthetic device made from silicone is the only option that can achieve a permanent increase in size. But this is a cosmetic surgery and is typically not covered by insurance.\nIf you’re interested in exploring penis enlargement, it’s a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional first. Most options haven’t been scientifically proven to work, and each one carries the risk of potentially serious complications.\nIllustration by Alyssa Kiefer\n## What penis size do cisgender women and other vulva-having partners want?\nMost of the research into partner penis preference is older and focuses on “females,” which can include [cisgender](https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/what-is-cis) women — people assigned female at birth and identify as such — or people with vulvas, regardless of how they identify.\nAccording to this [researchTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558040/), most prefer partners with average to slightly-above-average penises. That goes for one-night stands and long-term relationships.\nFYI, [researchTrusted Source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079) also shows that most are satisfied with their partner’s penis size.\n\n## What penis size do cisgender men and other penis-having partners want?\nThere’s even less research available on the penis size preferences of cisgender men and other penis-having folks who have sex with other penis owners.\nWhile we can’t say what size they prefer, [research](https://www.smsna.org/patients/did-you-know/what-is-the-average-penis-size) does indicate that penis owners who have sex with other penis owners have a more accurate view of penis size than those who have sex with vulva owners.\nPenis size also [influences the positionTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502076/) taken during penetrative sex. Those who consider their penis [smaller-than-average](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/small-penis-sex) are more likely to be the receptive partner while those who consider themselves [larger-than-average](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/big-penis-sex) are more likely to take on the penetrative role.\n\n## Ways to build confidence in your body\nConfidence plays a bigger role in satisfaction [in and out of the bedroom](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/how-to-be-a-better-lover).\nIf you’re unhappy with your body — below the belt or otherwise — these tips can [help improve](https://www.healthline.com/health/body-neutrality) your body image:\n\n\n- Work on not comparing yourself to others, including your friends and people in the media.\n\n- If you want to boost your sexual confidence, learn to work with what you have by experimenting with positio...",

The streaming service, which at launch we called “odd, angsty, and horny as hell,” has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. Now its library is so packed that we’ve declared it “[the new HBO](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-tv-plus-is-the-new-hbo-max/).”\nCurious but don’t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the [best movies on Apple TV+](https://www.wired.com/story/best-apple-tv-plus-movies/).) When you’re done, head over to our guides to the [best shows on Netflix](https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-best-shows-this-week/), [best movies on Hulu](https://www.wired.com/story/best-movies-hulu-right-now/), and [best movies on Amazon Prime](https://www.wired.com/story/best-amazon-prime-movies/), because you can never have too much television.\n*If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Based around the misfits of Slough House, where MI5 agents are sent when they biff it as spies, the show effortlessly jumps from shoot-outs and car chases to quirky conversations and camaraderie. The show's fourth season, which launched last year, was a little more subdued than the ones before, but the fifth, which rolls out this fall, promises to hit the gas. Catch up now.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/233KfE645krK8737uHoTfC7BxvRXkkQM7WY2W9n8MP1SLdZR9HC44yEQsv8zNdgPMBLPayMvhabqjxXeyobDqQyFRnN9UdkobqhMZxav77PyiDECfqkuGgizua5v1z7Hts3sVbc527PxFdCaYi1G171dkyXRZgn8gPCW6m18DjhX6v2GkAZBF8jLoZaLbpV2WP82joVy8f6zNnsFbX7AKwcBuL7bYCeWzcAGTNG3crFquJihqEdwJ1ngohvodBMhkR5rg5sRApv5MKKoGCLf1MBDBbjDJ8VKJ741Hij5PkJTzBTmMmjvvBTHMoHfUitYFbgiZBYHEQG5ZLNjEod198)\n## *The Morning Show*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Klq88ERaGuM) from.\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has *The Morning Show*. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) to revamp the show. What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. The new season, in which the office politics of the network get even more tense and intense, launched September 17.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-morning-show/umc.cmc.25tn3v8ku4b39tr6ccgb8nl6m)\n## *Platonic*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oNSs2vZQlGg) from.\nLook around and you'll see plenty of stories about how [men are lonely](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/22/loneliness-is-killing-men-and-without-proper-support-and-intervention-nothing-will-change) and [struggle to keep their friendships](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/magazine/male-friendships.html) as they get older. That doesn't happen on *Platonic*, a show about two longtime friends—Sylvia (Rose Byrne) and Will (Seth Rogen)—who are figuring out how to keep their relationship going even as romantic relationships and careers test the bonds they built when they were younger.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/hVt5qe48J652wmbzoNkNYi2gb47atzkDQYmhVTKt1QWhpBcEHDVUwKmELMVrmrZ9VgRZoEdLDxTdrhaDptCSxn82dLWKaBjmp9PuYPLDCW93LvuFktRZarYTNArAVHfYumxZ43vJuk4XVtyKZy5CErAfWWrgczAqRi5EBbNFCKkguZAdRy2jntvscRMXaXPdX2rDs199BUtiRGCqdjaX56faoDX3casjcBesVH7nnkyPD5yqggz36WtBKUb23dNpbeuP9ob84W2jRPZRmCDWsZyFexMuf84gQS7QaYQLb1HAF15Tq2JqL43PDXjZSRjMbMxuD18SxH69Q5Jk6)\n## *Chief of War*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/owdGcwufWK8) from.\nSet in the late 1700s, *Chief of War* tells the story of Ka’iana, a warrior who attempted to unite the Hawaiian islands before the arrival of colonizers from the West. Written and executive produced by star Jason Mamoa (*Aquaman*), it’s a nine-episode miniseries based on true events that is also a passion project for Mamoa and cocreator Thomas Pa‘a Sibbett. The premiere drops August 1 with new episodes arriving each Friday through September.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5a1FMimJbzYezMeMToA4fa2KPpoGk6a3mjMwdfkBSx8vqeN5ZYTnYXCCPjYGEUtqe4cagwmN27Jn8c6Jdie3egoGPYDwbKWy4qQbUDws43w8bvYcHwycwMyVodSbRUYgfSuq2BDa5JU3g8fbSU9Brq3gXfpwTz382qEFoFYzFF6Hg3B6wiiEcXa2X7Hsidu7T6FHLBF5qJZrrJmUGMjJHncDneTTGoiMXqyTU7hsdsdbFwRZgY7VzuhoA9ebJL67kAumkSDsBKAc2J2PrHctd8Cs88VGABayYRZQjdUKs3PxLuhS5KtaVxYSpYonNB46hubC53sJzSufrVg5Uqrwzn2)\n## *Foundation*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C53xEOdxz70) from.\nWIRED called *Foundation* a “flawed masterpiece” in our [review](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/foundation-apple-tv-review) of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images [inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.wired.com/story/think-foundation-is-beautiful-thank-the-james-webb-telescope/). If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this *Game-of-Thrones*-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3)\n## *Stick*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/72oB_zVF_6o) from.\nPryce Cahill is a former pro golfer who flopped during a big tournament 20 years ago and hasn’t been the same since. His marriage fell apart; his life is a shambles. Then one day he meets a kid who swings a club “like a dream” and decides to go all-in. Sound like an Owen Wilson vehicle? Something from the *Ted Lasso* school of prestige TV? It’s both. Starring Wilson as Pryce and on the same streamer as *Lasso*, it’s the kind of dramedy full of just enough sports platitudes to be compelling without being grating. Can it make n00bs love golf the way it got the uninitiated into football/soccer? Eh, that remains to be seen, but if you’re sad [about Marc Maron’s podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/arts/marc-maron-wtf-podcast-ends.html), this might be the one place you can get your dose of the comedian’s dry humor for the time being.\n[Watch on Apple TV+](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/UKMhwqGKSKJYLfcMthvh2fnFE7cs28pjwut2FGwV5Hu24PYuuJQ1LYkLxASaSi7E5jKXtyPU4u9BJJ18YrYkqw79wBAbhDNNEAHf5KkLZPgeUUzfR4xPRPUU31FX6C5Wqe9BLjFY4KkuuqTLwqwvZh7yfgPsbeQdkVawL3VRbm1vS8YJYqpHqrqorfpK3iiVr28wFBPsBVgMmHTYMM1MkkmHWVPgKkpHJTpbVE5R1c1ifW9uBsR2t3QiGEnc7P7wCwp6Sm2sQc2gy3B9Li8WWoaUVqSkeMiioJem8ZkM43Xn9q8T8CEqPQKh9sNzzvEvZZUdCohuuEx5C)\n## *Murderbot*\nContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it [originates](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEioDeOiqEs) from.\nFans of [Martha Wells](https://www.wired.com/story/murderbot-she-wrote-martha-wells/) have been waiting for *Murderbot* for a long time, pretty much since Apple TV+ announced in 2023 that it was adapting the sci-fi author's 2017 novella *All Systems Red*. That beloved book—and the series of stories and novels that followed it—serve as the basis for this splashy series and also for the big expectations that come with adapting a fan favorite. Murderbot, for those who don’t know, serves as both the protagonist of Wells’ stories and the lead of this series, here played by Alexander Skarsgård. It (Murderbot’s pronouns are “it”) has become what WIRED called “[one of the most iconic characters in 21st-century science fiction](https://www.wired.com/story/murderbot-she-wrote-martha-wells/)” thanks to its socially awkward charm and relatability.

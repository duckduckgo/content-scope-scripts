    "content": "# Peacemaker Season 3 Gets Definitive Update From James Gunn After Finale\n     Photograph by Jessica Miglio/HBO Max              By  [Graeme Guttmann](/author/graeme-guttmann/)    Published 6 days ago   Graeme Guttmann is a Senior Editor for ScreenRant, overseeing the News and Interview & Events team and now the Television News team. He began at ScreenRant in 2020 as a freelancer. He has also interviewed talent from various films and series, including Jennifer Coolidge, Mikey Madison, Emma Roberts, and more.\n \n Additionally, Graeme is also a critic for SR, having attended film festivals like Sundance, TIFF, SXSW, and Cannes. \n \n You can reach him at graeme.g@screenrant.com and read his criticism here: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/graeme-guttmann/movies                                           Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:                      After the season 2 finale, James Gunn offered an update on [***Peacemaker***](https://screenrant.com/db/movie/peacemaker/) season 3 and where the show's future lies in the broader landscape of the burgeoning DCU. [*Peacemaker *season 2 ended](https://screenrant.com/peacemaker-season-2-episode-8-ending-explained/) with Chris Smith trapped on Salvation, a newly-introduced planet where Rick Flagg is trapping metahumans in collaboration with Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor. \n Comic fans will recognize the prison world from a 7-issue Salvation miniseries, with Flagg working alongside Amanda Waller to trap the metahumans. This certainly indicates where a third season of *Peacemaker* could hypothetically go, but it seems Gunn is saving this story for another project.\n Speaking with *Deadline*, Gunn explained that there are no current plans for a third season of *Peacemaker. *Instead, the studio head will focus on other stories in his cinematic universe and how the events of the second season finale will impact that. Gunn does say that it's possible a third season could happen in the future. Until then, though, Chris Smith will be an important character in the DCU. Check out Gunn's full comments below: \n  No, this is about the wider DCU and other stories in which this will play out right now. That doesn’t mean that there won’t be. I don’t want to never say never, but right now, no, this is about the future of the DCU. It’s an important character.\n It's no surprise that Gunn isn't focusing on a third season of *Peacemaker* at the moment. The director first began work on the series before the revamp of the DCU, which saw him take over as head of the studio. While the second season of the series brought Peacemaker and the rest of the characters into this new universe, there is a wider story that Gunn is working on. \n [Upcoming DCU projects](https://screenrant.com/video/upcoming-live-action-dcu-tv-shows/) include 2026's *Supergirl* movie, the Batman villain flick *Clayface*, and the *Superman* sequel *Man of Tomorrow. *Gunn and co-studio head Peter Safran are currently working on fleshing out this wider universe and while it's clear John Cena's Chris Smith has a role to play, focusing on the HBO series is presumably on the backburner as work on a larger plan continues.\n Where *Peacemaker* characters will appear in the future remains a mystery, but Gunn is already taking big swings with his DCU, bringing various characters together in surprising ways. In the first DCU film alone, Gunn introduced Supergirl, Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, Guy Gardner, and more.\n From the jump, the world of the DCU is an active one, meaning ***Peacemaker*** characters are pretty much fair game for any upcoming project, no matter how big or small. \n                         **         7.9*/10*                   7*/10*    [### Peacemaker](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/peacemaker/)        10 stars  9 stars  8 stars  7 stars  6 stars  5 stars  4 stars  3 stars  2 stars  1 star                                  TV-MA [Drama](/tag/drama/) [Action](/tag/action-movies/) [Comedy](/tag/comedy/) [Science Fiction](/tag/sci-fi/)        **Release Date**    January 13, 2022      **Network**    HBO Max, Max      **Showrunner**    [James Gunn](/tag/james-gunn/)      **Directors**    [James Gunn](/tag/james-gunn/), Brad Anderson, Rosemary Rodriguez      **Writers**    [James Gunn](/tag/james-gunn/)              9 Images                  \n### Cast\n  [See All**](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/peacemaker/#cast-cand-crew)   \n \n- [John Cena](/tag/person/john-cena/) Christopher Smith / Peacemaker\n \n- [Danielle Brooks](/tag/person/danielle-brooks/) Leota Adebayo\n \n                     **Franchise(s)**    [DC Extended Universe](/tag/dc-extended-universe/)       **Creator(s)**    [James Gunn](/tag/james-gunn/)         [Powered by](https://screenrant.com/db/)  Expand             \n \n- [DC Extended Universe](/tag/dc-extended-universe/)\n \n- [Peacemaker](/db/movie/peacemaker/)\n \n       Follow        Like        Share                 Thread    Sign in to your ScreenRant account    We want to hear from you!

While competitors like Disney+ chase family-friendly fare and Netflix waters down content for mass appeal, Max continues serving up the bold, boundary-pushing projects that built its reputation. Although the platform offers wholesome content, such as *Sesame Street* and Studio Ghibli films, Max's true value lies in its dedication to raw, provocative storytelling.\n The platform's commitment to mature content proves especially valuable as other services sanitize their libraries. Even as Max courts mainstream audiences with DC Comics and Cartoon Network classics, it remains fearless in exploring human sexuality and desire. From steamy documentaries to [award-winning dramas like](https://www.cbr.com/tv-trend-killing-teen-drama/)*[Euphoria](https://www.cbr.com/tv-trend-killing-teen-drama/) *and *Game of Thrones*, the service delivers heat that makes censors sweat and audiences swoon.\n ***Updated on May 27, 2025, by Arthur Goyaz: ****Max has a fantastic selection of spicy shows directed at a more mature audience, from sexually charged fantasy dramas to provocative teen series. This list was updated to include more steamy shows streaming on Max and to reflect CBR's current publication standards. *\n \n##  15   Girls Follows a Group of Young Women Coming to Terms with Adulthood  \n\n###  The Ups and Downs of Life in the Big City \n      If *Sex and the City *is a satirical take on the yuppie community and their lavish NYC lifestyle, *Girls *is a tribute to all the young women struggling to make a living in New York. However, while *Sex and the City *relies heavily on caricature and catchy humor, *Girls *aims at a more realistic approach. The show follows the lives of four friends in their early twenties: Hannah, an inspiring writer; Marnie, who is falling out of love with her boyfriend; Shoshanna, a naive and unsuspecting virgin; and Jessa, the lively and dangerously reckless member of the group.\n     Related   [40 Best R-Rated TV Shows of All Time, Ranked](/best-r-rated-tv-shows-all-time-ranked/)  From Game of Thrones to Breaking Bad to The Sopranos, some of the best TV shows to date are those with mature audiences in mind.\n            By  [Natasha Elder](/author/natasha-elder/)   Jul 22, 2025     *Girls* centers around the ups and downs of their friendship as they navigate New York's busy nightlife and figure out their sexuality. There's an interesting dynamic between the lead female characters and **the vibrant male characters that orbit around them.** There's a character for everyone in *Girls*. It's easy to resonate with them even though they are deeply flawed people. The show does a great job of exploring the search for sex and affection in an era where meaningful relationships have lost their course.\n                                Rate Now                             [Girls](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/girls/)    Comedy        **Release Date**    2012 - 2016      **Network**    HBO Max      **Showrunner**    Lena Dunham      **Directors**    Lena Dunham            \n### Cast\n  [See All**](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/girls/#cast-cand-crew)   \n \n- Lena Dunham\n \n- Adam Driver\n \n- Allison Williams\n \n             A comedy about the experiences of a group of girls in their early 20s.\n        **Seasons**    6         [Powered by](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/girls/)  Expand        \n##  14   The White Lotus Is Just as Steamy as It Is Weird  \n\n###  A Controversial Examination of Upper-Class Perversions \n       Image via HBO   Few steamy shows on Max are willing to reach the extremes of sexual perversion of* The White Lotus*, which makes it one of the most unique shows out there. Every season is set at[the luxury White Lotus Hotel](https://www.cbr.com/the-white-lotus-season-3-confusing-details/) in a different region, introducing new characters and scandalous storylines that always lead to a horrific murder in the season finale. Considering it's a show about ridiculously rich people with nothing else to do but flirt with each other, complain, and spend money on frivolous things, chaos quickly breaks out.\n *The White Lotus* manages to find a baffling balance between sexy and weird. Most sex scenes on the show are there for comedic purposes, but they are always just the right amount of steamy. Every season effectively explores sex drive and pleasure from the perspective of different generations. It gets even better when the parallel storylines finally collide towards a shocking finale.\n                                Rate Now                                    [The White Lotus](/tag/the-white-lotus/)    TV-MA Comedy [Drama](/tag/drama/) Mystery       **        10*/10*          **Release Date**    2021 - 2024      **Network**    HBO      **Showrunner**    Mike White      **Directors**    Mike White            \n### Cast\n  [See All**](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/the-white-lotus/#cast-cand-crew)   \n \n- Jon Gries Greg Hunt\n \n- Natasha Rothwell Belinda Lindsey\n \n                    **Seasons**    3         [Powered by](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/the-white-lotus/)  Expand        \n##  13   Industry Is a Sex-Fueled Account of the Young Corporate World  \n\n###  Sales & Trading as a Coming-of-Age Allegory \n       Image via Max   There's nothing too arousing about the trade market and financial affairs, but* Industry *delves into corporate identity through the eyes of young, reckless characters full of sexual appetite.

Produced by HBO Latin America, it's a transgressive story about three Brazilian call girls who apply inventive bargaining strategies to stand out in the sex work business. With their growing success, they eventually establish their own company, \"Oceano Azul.\"\n *The Business* depicts the sex industry with a self-aware and often hilarious approach. Men are only foolish pawns in the calculated game played by the show's empowering female characters. By contrasting the girls' business with their personal struggles, the show explores the many facets of sex and its power to either save or corrupt each individual. *The Business* is not only a show about sex workers but also about equality, authority and identity.\n \n##  11   Entourage Depicts a World of Never-Ending Debauchery in the LA Film Scene  \n\n###  Hollywood's Spicy Backstage Knows No Limits \n       Image via HBO   *Entourage* is the ultimate comedy show about Hollywood and stardom. It focuses on Vincent Chase, an A-list movie star, and his group of childhood friends as they embark on a life of drug-fueled parties and never-ending promiscuity. The show unfolds mostly from a male perspective, lacking significant female characters throughout—elements that haven't aged well. However, its lively depiction of the film industry's chaos and the self-indulgent adventures of the main characters are highly entertaining.\n *Entourage*'s delightful ensemble and the characters' hedonistic lifestyle make for a stimulating watch. It's a nonchalant, steamy show that will appeal mainly to a male audience but has enough charm to bring everyone on board. The show's original idea was to simply film Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg, who serves as executive producer, hanging out with his friends. Still, the team decided to join forces to create a compelling satire of their unrestrained habits instead.\n                                Rate Now                             [Entourage](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/entourage/)    TV-MA Comedy [Drama](/tag/drama/)        **Release Date**    2004 - 2010            \n### Cast\n  [See All**](https://screen...",

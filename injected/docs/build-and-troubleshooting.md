# Platform-Specific Build & Troubleshooting Tips

This document provides platform-specific build instructions, troubleshooting steps, and local development tips for integrating and working with Content Scope Scripts (C-S-S) across iOS, macOS, Android, Windows, and browser extensions.

---

## iOS/macOS
- **Check Xcode Version:**
  - [.xcode-version](https://github.com/duckduckgo/apple-browsers/tree/main/.xcode-version)
- **Set up C-S-S or Autofill as a Local Dependency:**
  - Drag the folder from Finder into the directory panel in Xcode.
- **Privacy Config Files:**
  - Both apps bundle a privacy config file: [macos-config.json](https://github.com/duckduckgo/apple-browsers/blob/main/macOS/DuckDuckGo/ContentBlocker/macos-config.json) & [ios-config.json](https://github.com/duckduckgo/apple-browsers/blob/main/iOS/Core/ios-config.json).
  - To test privacy config changes, update this file as well as the config endpoint for remote updates ([macOS](https://github.com/duckduckgo/apple-browsers/blob/main/macOS/DuckDuckGo/Application/AppConfigurationURLProvider.swift#L60) & [iOS](https://github.com/duckduckgo/apple-browsers/blob/main/iOS/Core/AppURLs.swift#L49)).
- **If you receive errors related to packages:**
  - File > Packages > Reset Package Caches
  - Clean Project with `cmd+K`
  - Delete all files inside `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
  - If none of that works, ask for help in the [Apple Devs Mattermost channel](https://chat.duckduckgo.com/ddg/channels/devs).

## Android
- [Override the Privacy Remote Config](https://app.asana.com/1/137249556945/project/1202561462274611/task/1203855276415003?focus=true)
  - Ensure the config version is higher than the current version (the app may refuse to update otherwise).
- **Clean Project:**
  - Build â†’ 'Clean Project' (clears cache of potentially stale C-S-S file).
  - Uninstall the app from the emulator as well.
- **Linking Local Dependencies:**
  - Use `npm link @duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts` or `npm link @duckduckgo/autofill` to link to your local checkout.
  - In that directory, also run `npm link` in the dependency folder.
  - This symlinks to your local dir and acts as if you're pointing to your PR.
  - Run `npm build` in C-S-S (not run automatically like in the extension).
- **Alternative Android Setup (more reliable):**
  - Alter the path of the resources in the appropriate module's `build.gradle` to an absolute path on your machine.
    - Example: [build.gradle gist](https://gist.github.com/shakyShane/0b133a0782bdb37c876c4a4204667bb2)
  - After making this change, click 'sync now' when Gradle prompts.
  - All changes in C-S-S will be picked up every time you restart the app.
  - This works for all JS dependencies (Autofill, Dashboard, C-S-S, etc).

## Windows
- [Work with content-scope-scripts repo on Windows](../development-utilities.md#windows-development)
- [Debugging `autofill.js` (or other submodules) on Windows](https://app.asana.com/1/137249556945/project/1198964220583541/task/1208938714611510)

## Extensions
- Use npm link as per Android.
- See the [other development steps](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-extension).

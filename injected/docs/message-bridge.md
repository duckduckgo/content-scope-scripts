title: Message Bridge
---

## Description

Message Bridge creates a communication between a website and a browser. It sends and receives messages that conform
to our Messaging standard (eg: it's not a new format!)

- Related Privacy Configuration [feature file](https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/blob/main/features/message-bridge.json)
- Message formats: {@link "Messaging Schema"}

## Integration guide

## Step 1: add `messageSecret` to `$USER_PREFERENCES$`

This feature requires the following to be serialized into `$USER_PREFERENCES$`.

- `"messageSecret": "<some uuid>"`

Without this, the bridge will refuse to be installed.

Example:

```json
{
    "...": "...",
    "messageSecret": ""
}
```

## Step 2: Enable in remote config

Using the method of your choice, generate a remote config file that has the bridge feature
enabled + some feature & domain combinations.

For example, to enable `aiChat` on `duckduckgo.com` domains - you would place the following override
in the relevant platform file. This is how the per-domain restrictions are enforced in the JavaScript layer.

```json
{
    "features": {
        "...": "...",
        "messageBridge": {
            "state": "enabled",
            "settings": {
                "aiChat": "disabled",
                "domains": [
                    {
                        "domain": "duckduckgo.com",
                        "patchSettings": [
                            {
                                "op": "replace",
                                "path": "/aiChat",
                                "value": "enabled"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**NOTE:** Native platforms should continue to verify the sending domain when any messages are received.

## Example

In a domain where the bridge is enabled, the following API becomes available to the page.

```javascript
const bridge = navigator.duckduckgo?.createMessageBridge?.('exampleFeature');
bridge.notify('pixel');
```

That `notify` ^ call will result in a {@link "Messaging Schema".NotificationMessage "NotificationMessage"} being sent
to the 'native' layer.

```json
{
    "context": "contentScopeScriptsIsolated",
    "featureName": "exampleFeature",
    "method": "pixel"
}
```

Likewise with `Requests` and `Subscriptions` - as far as the 'native' side is concerned, they are handled with the same
Messaging Schema types.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing MessageName Debugging

**If you see missing 'messageName' in the browser debug console:**

This means the feature you're expecting to run **isn't running**.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check that the feature is enabled in the config (see remote config debugging).
2. Verify platform parameters allow the feature.
3. Check that the injected script is correct (see [build-and-troubleshooting.md](./build-and-troubleshooting.md#critical-debugging-step-validate-injected-script-integrity) for verification steps).
4. Verify message handlers are properly registered in the native app.
5. Check that the messaging bridge is correctly initialized.
6. Verify `messageSecret` is properly set in `$USER_PREFERENCES$` (see [Integration guide](#integration-guide) above).

# Single-workspace change reporting

When summarizing work or reporting what changed, first determine whether the diff touches **only one** top-level workspace directory:

- `injected/`
- `special-pages/`
- `messaging/`
- `types-generator/`

## Rule

- If **all changed files** are under exactly one of the directories above, **do not** produce a multi-file or cross-workspace change report.
- Instead, report **only**:
  - the **current branch name**, and
  - a **link to the branch** on GitHub.

Use this branch URL shape:

- `https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/tree/<branch>`

## Output template

- **Branch**: `<branch>`
- **Link**: `https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/tree/<branch>`

## Notes

- If changes span **multiple** workspace directories (or touch files outside these directories), produce the normal detailed report.

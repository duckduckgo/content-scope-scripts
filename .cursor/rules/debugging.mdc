# Rule: Content Scope Scripts (C-S-S) Development Debugging

## Overview
When developing or debugging Content Scope Scripts, validate script integrity, build outputs, and injection across all platforms.

## Debugging Resources

### Script Integrity and Build Issues

**`injected/docs/build-and-troubleshooting.md`** - covers:
- **Verification Steps** - Validate injected script integrity across build directory, native app, and web inspector
- **Config and Platform Parameters Validation** - Using `processConfig` breakpoint to validate config state and platform parameters
- **Build Branch Hash Validation** - For native engineers using build branches
- **Quick Validation Test** - Test page for verifying C-S-S injection
- Platform-specific setup and troubleshooting (iOS/macOS, Android, Windows, Extensions)
- Source maps configuration
- Local dependency linking

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Release process:
- **Breaking Changes Protocol** - Versioning and release coordination

### Messaging and Feature Issues

**`injected/docs/message-bridge.md`** - Messaging troubleshooting:
- Missing messageName debugging
- Message handler registration
- Messaging bridge initialization

### Feature Not Working Checklist

When a feature is not working, use the triage checklist in:

**`injected/docs/build-and-troubleshooting.md#feature-not-working-triage-checklist`**:
- Feature enabled in config and site object
- Feature bundled on the platform
- Sub-feature or setting enabled
- Messaging wired and listened to

### Additional Resources

- **`injected/docs/features-guide.md`** - Feature development and debugging
- **`injected/docs/testing-guide.md`** - Testing and validation approaches

## Platform-Specific Build and Troubleshooting

For detailed platform-specific build instructions, troubleshooting steps, and local development tips, see:

**`injected/docs/build-and-troubleshooting.md`**

This includes:
- Platform-specific setup instructions (iOS/macOS, Android, Windows, Extensions)
- Source maps configuration
- Local dependency linking
- Privacy config file locations
- Common troubleshooting steps for each platform
